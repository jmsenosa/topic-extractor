    "text": "MANILA, Philippines - New sugar block farms would soon rise in various provinces as a result of a memorandum of understanding signed among three government agencies. The Departments of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (DAR) and the Sugar Regulatory Administration forged an agreement Thursday for \"collaborative and complementary efforts for the establishment and management of sugar block farms in several provinces. These provinces include Cagayan, Isabela, Tarlac, Pampanga, Batangas, Albay, Camarines Sur, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, Cebu, Leyte, Ormoc, Bukidnon, Davao del Sur, and North Cotobato. \"The identification and selection of the sugar block farms are based on an agreed set of criteria and discussed during the series of consultation meetings at field level. Separate memoranda of agreement shall be agreed upon and executed by DAR,\" the MOU said. The three agencies would pour in resources and technical expertise into the project. The DA shall initially provide P1.7 billion while the DAR shall extend P4.2 million in funding.   Business ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1   The SRA's initial counterpart funding, on the other hand, shall be P3.06 million. The funds would be sourced from the General Appropriations Act of 2015 and the SRA Corporate Fund. The three agencies would identify the technical parameters of the project. The SRA introduced the block farming system for sugarcane lands in 2012 in collaboration with the DA and DAR to increase the productivity of cultivation areas. Under the system, small farms of less than five hectares are consolidated into blocks of at least 30 hectares while preserving ownership. Farm productivity is improved through the establishment of integrated sugar production systems and systematic provision of farm inputs and technical assistance. Around 85 percent of sugarcane farmers in the country have land holdings of five hectares and below due to land division by inheritance, sale and award under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). Sugarcane, being a plantation crop, requires farm sizes of at least 30 hectares for cost efficiency in production. The SRA earlier said with the aggressive implementation of CARP, landholders could no longer take advantage of economies of scale because of lack of financial ability to provide farm inputs. Several sugar block farms established by the SRA for pilot testing have reported a 29 percent average increase in productivity in crop year 2013-2014 from the previous crop year. According to the SRA, the 19 pilot block farms set up in Luzon and Visayas harvested an average of 65.29 tons of cane per hectare during crop year 2013 to 2014, up from the average yield of 50.78 tons per hectare upon the program's implementation in 2012. The block farm program aims for the eventual conversion of consolidated sugarcane farms into agribusiness centers through professionalized farm management and mechanized farming. To date, 130 block farms have been enrolled under the program, covering a total area of 7,000 hectares.",

    "text": "We have heard of the top performing agencies like the Bangko Sentral, PEZA, Tourism, Foreign Affairs and PAGASA. We have also heard that the Office of the Vice President is the least performing. All these are according to the big bosses of Philippine business responding to a survey of the Makati Business Club. BSP and PEZA are really hands down winners. Both agencies under the leadership of Gov. Say Tetangco and Lilia de Lima, have been tirelessly working through the years to promote our country's economic growth even under most trying times. No matter how corrupt or incompetent the leader in Malacanang may have been, both agencies simply delivered. PAGASA is the most inspiring of the top five. The weather scientists working under conditions that are less than ideal have shown what sheer dedication can do. They have also proven that given a little more budgetary support to get proper equipment, they are able to provide the life saving forecasting service to our people. Now, let us go to the last ten in MBC's sample of 64 government agencies. These are: the Court of Appeals, Agrarian Reform, Lower Courts, MWSS, PNP, Energy Regulatory Board, Agriculture, Customs, DOTC, OVP. They did not rate NTC but it will likely end up with this bunch because people are angry about slow broadband speeds at the highest rates. I can understand why the Court of Appeals is in this bottom list. Its reputation had been seriously tarnished even before a senator made some accusations about its handling of the Binay case.  The Agrarian Reform bureaucracy is noted for lack of performance and corruption through the years. This is probably why the program is a failure. The bureaucracy and the program should be consigned to the garbage heap.  Business ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1    Lower courts? Slow and disruptive. TROs for sale...  MWSS could have done more but it is not because it didn't try hard enough. I think it caught the ire of the Makati taipans because the regulatory office of MWSS took a hard position on behalf of consumers on rate adjustments. Indeed, I think the current crop of MWSS officials should be commended for doing what they could to clean up operations. Where MWSS could have done a whole lot more is in the development of alternative water sources to reduce dependence on Angat Dam. I am also aware of how the current MWSS Administrator tried to get the retrofitting work for Angat done early in his watch but was stymied by government procedures and contrary plans such as DOF's protracted privatization negotiation. It is not unexpected to see the PNP near the bottom part of the dishonor roll. It was led by a P-Noy kabarkada who was ousted by the Ombudsman. The reputation of the leader reflected on the public perception of the organization. Besides, we don't feel secure and until we all do, we will continue to think of the national police as a failure. The public trust level of our police is dangerously low. The PNP's biggest challenge is winning our trust. When that happens, we can start to believe their crime statistics which they claim show an improvement.  The ERC is another agency with a credibility problem. It might help that it has a new chairman, a young technocrat who seems to understand his job. The presence of a nominee of a power company among its commissioners makes it difficult to shake off the impression of regulatory capture. ERC's big test will be its decision on that controversial increase in power rate December 2013. Preliminary findings seem to show evidence of price manipulation by some of the largest power conglomerates. Consumers will be closely watching what ERC's final verdict will be. The Agriculture department has been a colossal failure under P-Noy. Its head should have resigned when P-Noy, having noticed the problem, assigned Kiko Pangilinan to take over the department's most important agencies. I am not surprised it is in the kulelat list. Customs is one of the least respected agencies of government. Our Daang Matuwid President fired a reform minded head and replaced him with someone who has a very clear conflict of interest. I don't think, based on what I hear from businessmen dealing with the bureau, that this conflict has been resolved. I heard that most of its credibility problems can be traced to the Office of the President. I understand one of the deputy commissioners has written a report on that Daang Baluktot to P-Noy.  But I don't think the Customs people mind being in this dishonor roll of corrupt and poorly functioning government agencies as long as the kalakaran is alive and well. As P-Noy himself puts it in one of his SONAs, they are shameless... He asked: Saan kayo kumukuha ng kapal ng mukha? The second most despised agency, according to the Makati businessmen, is DOTC. Why am I not surprised? There is nothing more I can write here I have not written before. It is a horrible non performing agency that will haunt Mar Roxas in next year's election. The kulelat is the OVP. Why was it even rated? There is nothing clear about the OVP's function. I suspect the Makati Business Club rating merely reflected the corruption image of VP Jojo Binay. So there... both ends of the spectrum... the good and the bad. Hopefully, we get inspiring performance from some of the kulelat agencies next time.  Tourism Here is a foreigner's view of our tourism efforts. Hi. First, I must say I enjoy, whether I agree or not with your points of view, reading your columns in the business section of The Philippine Star. As a foreigner who has lived in the Philippines on and off for 30 of the last 45 years, I feel compelled to comment on today's column. The main problem with attracting more tourists to the Philippines is that the environment is, well, filthy in most places. I always laugh when I read that the Philippines has some of the finest beaches in the world. Could be true, if one could get past the polluted beaches and water. How bad is it? We once had a cottage next to the ocean in La Union. I would go out every day to clean up the trash on the beach. While the local folks loved to watch me clean, I never actually saw anyone else clean the beach. Almost to a person, the onlookers were fishermen who depended upon the sea for their livelihood. Still they never got the connection between a clean ocean and a good catch. Even here in Baguio, unless you confine yourself to the Country Club or John Hay, you will never smell the flowers or pine trees which once made Baguio famous. The common smells are urine, trash thrown everywhere, and dog feces from uncontrolled animals. Good thing man can't totally screw up the cool climate, or that'd be gone too. Foreigners don't mind poor, they don't mind traditional, they don't mind rustic, but they hate filth. Till the culture gets a handle on correcting that, there's not much else that can be done to increase tourism in the Philippines significantly. Sorry for being so honest.  And now a view from a Pinoy. Hello Mr. Chanco, Good article again today, thank you. Aside from infrastructure, accommodations, costs... I'd like to add another reason why we can't match the numbers of our neighbors: CRIME. I travel very often around the Asean region for business. I also make it a point to check out the local papers' front and Metro pages. No country comes close to ours in terms of robberies, kidnappings, swindling and most notably - gun-related violence. Victims here get shot and killed over a minor traffic incident, an argument over a small debt, a cellphone, singing My Way at the karaoke bar, and last but not the least, elections. The very people I do business with say they are afraid to visit Manila - while they proudly claim they have visited most of the Asean countries and enjoyed it. Perhaps the locals there are smart enough not to victimize the tourists because they know this is the goose that lays the green dollars. And when there is an exception, the local media does not sensationalize it (\"Ativan gang victimizes European\"). Crime is so lucrative here that even the criminals in those countries fly over here to victimize their fellow nationals (we've read about those Korean and Chinese gangs exclusively targeting their own). So aside from the DOTC and the DOT, we have to add to the honor roll the DILG and PNP. Thank you again for your enlightened columns. I look forward to reading your section MWF, even when I'm on the road (where Philstar.com downloads much faster). Boo Chanco's e-mail address is bchanco@gmail.com. Follow him on Twitter @boochanco",

    "content_html": "<div> <div><p>We have heard of the top performing agencies like the Bangko Sentral, PEZA, Tourism, Foreign Affairs and PAGASA. We have also heard that the Office of the Vice President is the least performing. All these are according to the big bosses of Philippine business responding to a survey of the Makati Business Club.</p> <p>BSP and PEZA are really hands down winners. Both agencies under the leadership of Gov. Say Tetangco and Lilia de Lima, have been tirelessly working through the years to promote our countryâ€™s economic growth even under most trying times. No matter how corrupt or incompetent the leader in Malacanang may have been, both agencies simply delivered.</p> <p>PAGASA is the most inspiring of the top five. The weather scientists working under conditions that are less than ideal have shown what sheer dedication can do. They have also proven that given a little more budgetary support to get proper equipment, they are able to provide the life saving forecasting service to our people.</p> <p>Now, let us go to the last ten in MBCâ€™s sample of 64 government agencies. These are: the Court of Appeals, Agrarian Reform, Lower Courts, MWSS, PNP, Energy Regulatory Board, Agriculture, Customs, DOTC, OVP. They did not rate NTC but it will likely end up with this bunch because people are angry about slow broadband speeds at the highest rates.</p> <p>I can understand why the Court of Appeals is in this bottom list. Its reputation had been seriously tarnished even before a senator made some accusations about its handling of the Binay case. </p> <p>The Agrarian Reform bureaucracy is noted for lack of performance and corruption through the years. This is probably why the program is a failure. The bureaucracy and the program should be consigned to the garbage heap.</p><div> <div> Business ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 </div> </div> <h3> <strong>Lower courts? Slow and disruptive. TROs for sale... </strong></h3> <p>MWSS could have done more but it is not because it didnâ€™t try hard enough. I think it caught the ire of the Makati taipans because the regulatory office of MWSS took a hard position on behalf of consumers on rate adjustments. Indeed, I think the current crop of MWSS officials should be commended for doing what they could to clean up operations.</p> <p>Where MWSS could have done a whole lot more is in the development of alternative water sources to reduce dependence on Angat Dam. I am also aware of how the current MWSS Administrator tried to get the retrofitting work for Angat done early in his watch but was stymied by government procedures and contrary plans such as DOFâ€™s protracted privatization negotiation.</p> <p>It is not unexpected to see the PNP near the bottom part of the dishonor roll. It was led by a P-Noy kabarkada who was ousted by the Ombudsman. The reputation of the leader reflected on the public perception of the organization. Besides, we donâ€™t feel secure and until we all do, we will continue to think of the national police as a failure.</p> <p>The public trust level of our police is dangerously low. The PNPâ€™s biggest challenge is winning our trust. When that happens, we can start to believe their crime statistics which they claim show an improvement. </p> <p>The ERC is another agency with a credibility problem. It might help that it has a new chairman, a young technocrat who seems to understand his job. The presence of a nominee of a power company among its commissioners makes it difficult to shake off the impression of regulatory capture.</p> <p>ERCâ€™s big test will be its decision on that controversial increase in power rate December 2013. Preliminary findings seem to show evidence of price manipulation by some of the largest power conglomerates. Consumers will be closely watching what ERCâ€™s final verdict will be.</p> <p>The Agriculture department has been a colossal failure under P-Noy. Its head should have resigned when P-Noy, having noticed the problem, assigned Kiko Pangilinan to take over the departmentâ€™s most important agencies. I am not surprised it is in the kulelat list.</p> <p>Customs is one of the least respected agencies of government. Our Daang Matuwid President fired a reform minded head and replaced him with someone who has a very clear conflict of interest. I donâ€™t think, based on what I hear from businessmen dealing with the bureau, that this conflict has been resolved.</p> <p>I heard that most of its credibility problems can be traced to the Office of the President. I understand one of the deputy commissioners has written a report on that Daang Baluktot to P-Noy. </p> <p>But I donâ€™t think the Customs people mind being in this dishonor roll of corrupt and poorly functioning government agencies as long as the kalakaran is alive and well. As P-Noy himself puts it in one of his SONAs, they are shameless... He asked: Saan kayo kumukuha ng kapal ng mukha?</p> <p>The second most despised agency, according to the Makati businessmen, is DOTC. Why am I not surprised? There is nothing more I can write here I have not written before. It is a horrible non performing agency that will haunt Mar Roxas in next yearâ€™s election.</p> <p>The kulelat is the OVP. Why was it even rated? There is nothing clear about the OVPâ€™s function. I suspect the Makati Business Club rating merely reflected the corruption image of VP Jojo Binay.</p> <p>So thereâ€¦ both ends of the spectrumâ€¦ the good and the bad. Hopefully, we get inspiring performance from some of the kulelat agencies next time.</p> <h3> <strong>Tourism</strong></h3> <p>Here is a foreignerâ€™s view of our tourism efforts.</p> <p>Hi. First, I must say I enjoy, whether I agree or not with your points of view, reading your columns in the business section of The Philippine Star.</p> <p>As a foreigner who has lived in the Philippines on and off for 30 of the last 45 years, I feel compelled to comment on todayâ€™s column.</p> <p>The main problem with attracting more tourists to the Philippines is that the environment is, well, filthy in most places. I always laugh when I read that the Philippines has some of the finest beaches in the world. Could be true, if one could get past the polluted beaches and water.</p> <p>How bad is it? We once had a cottage next to the ocean in La Union. I would go out every day to clean up the trash on the beach. While the local folks loved to watch me clean, I never actually saw anyone else clean the beach. Almost to a person, the onlookers were fishermen who depended upon the sea for their livelihood. Still they never got the connection between a clean ocean and a good catch.</p> <p>Even here in Baguio, unless you confine yourself to the Country Club or John Hay, you will never smell the flowers or pine trees which once made Baguio famous. The common smells are urine, trash thrown everywhere, and dog feces from uncontrolled animals. Good thing man canâ€™t totally screw up the cool climate, or thatâ€™d be gone too.</p> <p>Foreigners donâ€™t mind poor, they donâ€™t mind traditional, they donâ€™t mind rustic, but they hate filth. Till the culture gets a handle on correcting that, thereâ€™s not much else that can be done to increase tourism in the Philippines significantly.</p> <p>Sorry for being so honest. </p> <p>And now a view from a Pinoy.</p> <p><strong>Hello Mr. Chanco,</strong></p> <p>Good article again today, thank you.</p> <p>Aside from infrastructure, accommodations, costs... Iâ€™d like to add another reason why we canâ€™t match the numbers of our neighbors: CRIME.</p> <p>I travel very often around the Asean region for business. I also make it a point to check out the local papersâ€™ front and Metro pages. No country comes close to ours in terms of robberies, kidnappings, swindling and most notably â€“ gun-related violence.</p> <p>Victims here get shot and killed over a minor traffic incident, an argument over a small debt, a cellphone, singing My Way at the karaoke bar, and last but not the least, elections.</p> <p>The very people I do business with say they are afraid to visit Manila â€“ while they proudly claim they have visited most of the Asean countries and enjoyed it.</p> <p>Perhaps the locals there are smart enough not to victimize the tourists because they know this is the goose that lays the green dollars. And when there is an exception, the local media does not sensationalize it (â€œAtivan gang victimizes Europeanâ€).</p> <p>Crime is so lucrative here that even the criminals in those countries fly over here to victimize their fellow nationals (weâ€™ve read about those Korean and Chinese gangs exclusively targeting their own).</p> <p>So aside from the DOTC and the DOT, we have to add to the honor roll the DILG and PNP.</p> <p>Thank you again for your enlightened columns. I look forward to reading your section MWF, even when Iâ€™m on the road (where Philstar.com downloads much faster).</p> <p>Boo Chancoâ€™s e-mail address is <a href=\"http://whlnk.com/Slge\">bchanco@gmail.com</a>. Follow him on Twitter @boochanco</p> </div> </div>"

    "text": "MANILA - The government raised P25 billion yesterday from the auction of Treasury bonds, the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) reported. The debt papers maturing on 2020 were a fresh issuance with a coupon rate of 3.375 percent. National Treasurer Roberto Tan told reporters after the auction the sustained demand from investors allowed the government to make a full award of the P25-billion offer. \"I think we got a very good auction volume which reflects the demand and the seriousness of those who are bidding,\" Tan said. Tenders reached P51.603 billion, more than double the P25-billion offer. Tan said the government is comfortable with the resulting yield given the recent increase in trading as investors reposition themselves in the market. Proceeds from the auction of T-bonds and T-bills help the government pay for maturing loans and fund projects and programs. The government has programmed to borrow P710.8 billion this year, more than four-fifths of which will be sourced from the auction of debt papers. In a related development, Tan said terms of the planned peso-denominated bond swap later this year are already being finalized. \"We're reaching that point and we will announce it once we have it,\" Tan said, adding a meeting with arrangers has been scheduled for Aug. 19. He said the government is not looking at raising funds from the debt swap, which was approved by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas earlier this month. \"The new money component will really just be for administrative and transaction expenses so there's really no new money for the cash reserves,\" Tan said. The government said earlier a bond swap will likely occur before an increase in US interest rates, which is expected to increase volatility in global financial markets.

    "text": "MANILA, Philippines - The government raised P25 billion yesterday from the auction of Treasury bonds, the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) reported. The debt papers maturing on 2020 were a fresh issuance with a coupon rate of 3.375 percent. National Treasurer Roberto Tan told reporters after the auction the sustained demand from investors allowed the government to make a full award of the P25-billion offer. \"I think we got a very good auction volume which reflects the demand and the seriousness of those who are bidding,\" Tan said. Tenders reached P51.603 billion, more than double the P25-billion offer. Tan said the government is comfortable with the resulting yield given the recent increase in trading as investors reposition themselves in the market. Proceeds from the auction of T-bonds and T-bills help the government pay for maturing loans and fund projects and programs.  Business ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1   The government has programmed to borrow P710.8 billion this year, more than four-fifths of which will be sourced from the auction of debt papers. In a related development, Tan said terms of the planned peso-denominated bond swap later this year are already being finalized. \"We're reaching that point and we will announce it once we have it,\" Tan said, adding a meeting with arrangers has been scheduled for Aug. 19. He said the government is not looking at raising funds from the debt swap, which was approved by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas earlier this month. \"The new money component will really just be for administrative and transaction expenses so there's really no new money for the cash reserves,\" Tan said. The government said earlier a bond swap will likely occur before an increase in US interest rates, which is expected to increase volatility in global financial markets.",

    "text": "ATHENS - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to call a confidence vote in his government after the country's third bailout deal with international creditors sparked a rebellion within his party, one of his ministers indicated yesterday.  Expectations of a confidence vote, which could lead to early elections, heightened after last Friday's parliamentary vote in favor of the 86 billion euro three-year ($93 billion) bailout passed thanks to opposition support and saw dozens of lawmakers in Tsipras' Syriza party dissent.  Without the bailout, Greece faces defaulting on its debts and eventually being forced out of Europe's joint currency, the euro.  \"I consider it self-evident, after the deep wounding of the parliamentary majority and in particular of the parliamentary group of Syriza, for there to be a move that at least approaches the issue,\" Energy and Environment Minister Panos Skourletis told Skai television when asked about the possibility of the government calling a confidence vote.  Skourletis added that early elections may also be necessary in light of the political instability.  The government has said its priority is currently securing the bailout funding, which it needs by Thursday to meet a large debt repayment to the European Central Bank, and that any further decisions on the political situation will be taken from then on.  World ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1    In order to secure the bailout deal, Tsipras reneged on the promises that saw his radical left Syriza party win January elections. Syriza's coalition government with the small nationalist Independent Greeks was premised on a pledge to repeal austerity measures tied to Greece's two previous international bailouts.  Instead, after months of floundering negotiations with international creditors, the government accepted demands for steep tax hikes and deep spending cuts.  The about-face has angered an increasing number of Syriza lawmakers, including prominent members such as former ministers of finance Yanis Varoufakis, and energy Panagiotis Lafazanis. Both voted against the government.  Last week Lafazanis -- who was replaced as minister in a reshuffle last month after opposing the government in a previous bailout-related vote -- and another 12 left-wing politicians announced they were creating a new anti-austerity movement, although Lafazanis stopped short of quitting the party.  If a confidence vote is called, a parliamentary debate would start two days later, with a vote held after a maximum three-day discussion. Tsipras will need the support of a majority of lawmakers present in the 300-member parliament -- and not less than 120 -- for his government to survive.  Opposition parties have indicated they will not back Tsipras in a confidence vote, so the outcome will depend on Syriza dissenters.  If many vote against, they will bring down the government. However, if they chose not to be present, Tsipras would need fewer votes and could survive.  The turmoil has raised the possibility of general elections being called as soon as next month.  Asked about the possibility, Skourletis said he believed such a move was necessary in order to tackle the political instability. He noted that the bailout meant the situation had now changed compared to when Syriza initially won its popular mandate.  \"I would say the elections are necessary,\" Skourletis said. \"Because given the problems in the governing majority, today's situation can be described as anything but stable.\"  \"If we don't see it in the foreseeable future, then instability will be what determines developments,\" he added.  Elections would be held three to four weeks after being declared.  Despite his U-turn, Tsipras has remained popular and is believed to be well-placed to win a forthcoming election. Although no opinion polls have been published since the end of last week when Greece's third bailout was finalized, previous polls showed his party enjoying a wide lead over opposition parties.",

    "content_html": "<div> <div><p>ATHENS - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to call a confidence vote in his government after the country's third bailout deal with international creditors sparked a rebellion within his party, one of his ministers indicated yesterday.</p> <p> Expectations of a confidence vote, which could lead to early elections, heightened after last Friday's parliamentary vote in favor of the 86 billion euro three-year ($93 billion) bailout passed thanks to opposition support and saw dozens of lawmakers in Tsipras' Syriza party dissent.</p> <p> Without the bailout, Greece faces defaulting on its debts and eventually being forced out of Europe's joint currency, the euro.</p> <p> \"I consider it self-evident, after the deep wounding of the parliamentary majority and in particular of the parliamentary group of Syriza, for there to be a move that at least approaches the issue,\" Energy and Environment Minister Panos Skourletis told Skai television when asked about the possibility of the government calling a confidence vote.</p> <p> Skourletis added that early elections may also be necessary in light of the political instability.</p> <p> The government has said its priority is currently securing the bailout funding, which it needs by Thursday to meet a large debt repayment to the European Central Bank, and that any further decisions on the political situation will be taken from then on.</p><div> <div> World ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 </div> </div> <p> In order to secure the bailout deal, Tsipras reneged on the promises that saw his radical left Syriza party win January elections. Syriza's coalition government with the small nationalist Independent Greeks was premised on a pledge to repeal austerity measures tied to Greece's two previous international bailouts.</p> <p> Instead, after months of floundering negotiations with international creditors, the government accepted demands for steep tax hikes and deep spending cuts.</p> <p> The about-face has angered an increasing number of Syriza lawmakers, including prominent members such as former ministers of finance Yanis Varoufakis, and energy Panagiotis Lafazanis. Both voted against the government.</p> <p> Last week Lafazanis â€” who was replaced as minister in a reshuffle last month after opposing the government in a previous bailout-related vote â€” and another 12 left-wing politicians announced they were creating a new anti-austerity movement, although Lafazanis stopped short of quitting the party.</p> <p> If a confidence vote is called, a parliamentary debate would start two days later, with a vote held after a maximum three-day discussion. Tsipras will need the support of a majority of lawmakers present in the 300-member parliament â€” and not less than 120 â€” for his government to survive.</p> <p> Opposition parties have indicated they will not back Tsipras in a confidence vote, so the outcome will depend on Syriza dissenters.</p> <p> If many vote against, they will bring down the government. However, if they chose not to be present, Tsipras would need fewer votes and could survive.</p> <p> The turmoil has raised the possibility of general elections being called as soon as next month.</p> <p> Asked about the possibility, Skourletis said he believed such a move was necessary in order to tackle the political instability. He noted that the bailout meant the situation had now changed compared to when Syriza initially won its popular mandate.</p> <p> \"I would say the elections are necessary,\" Skourletis said. \"Because given the problems in the governing majority, today's situation can be described as anything but stable.\"</p> <p> \"If we don't see it in the foreseeable future, then instability will be what determines developments,\" he added.</p> <p> Elections would be held three to four weeks after being declared.</p> <p> Despite his U-turn, Tsipras has remained popular and is believed to be well-placed to win a forthcoming election. Although no opinion polls have been published since the end of last week when Greece's third bailout was finalized, previous polls showed his party enjoying a wide lead over opposition parties.</p> </div> </div>"

    "text": "MANILA, Aug. 18 -- The Government of Japan will consider assistance to the Philippines on water resources management particularly the construction of dams, sabo technology, retarding basin and other flood control structures including sharing of expertise and technologies. Visiting Japanese Minister Akihiro Ohta of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism is open to the proposal of Public Works and Highways Secretary Rogelio L. Singson in providing cooperation program on flood mitigation and management. Earlier, Secretary Singson has expressed its gratitude to Japanese government for the full support to the country's infrastructure development particularly through a number of Official Development Assistance (ODA) provided to improve and modernize the Philippines' infrastructure. Secretary Singson also proposed for possible inclusion of training and capacity building program assistance on water resources and flood management for selected young civil engineers joining DPWH in its recruitment program which the Japanese Minister believes is a good idea and in need of further discussion. Singson said that the DPWH has developed a flood control master plan for Metro Manila to include the structural measures for the Pasig-Marikina River Basin and adjacent areas. The design of a proposed dam project to be constructed in the upstream portion of Upper Marikina River in Rodriguez, Rizal is now being finalized by the DPWH. Minister Ohta expressed his admiration for Secretary Singson and the Aquino administration for coming up with a long term vision for flood mitigation and roadmap for transport infrastructure development that will address worsening traffic in Metro Manila and surrounding areas. The Government of Japan thru Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provided invaluable assistance in the development of transport roadmap with the goal of modernizing transport facilities. In his visit in Manila, the Japanese Minister with his party had a brief tour of the Pasig-Marikina River Channel Improvement Project which is now on its third phase of implementation. The project is financed through a loan granted to the Philippines by JICA. Implemented by the DPWH, over a million people will directly benefit from the mitigating structural measures for the Pasig-Marikina River Basin and adjacent areas. Later, Singson and Ohta witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation between Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) headed by its President and Chief Executive Officer Arnel Paciano D. Casanova and Japan Overseas Infrastructure Investment Corporation for Transport and Urban Development (JOIN) headed by its President and Chief Executive Officer Takuma Hatano for the Clark Green City Project in Clarkfield, Pampanga particularly in the establishment of project implementation framework to enable the project commercially and economically viable for private business and investors and attract project financing.

The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and Board of Investments (BOI) said they have strengthened programs as well as beefed up frontline services to build a sustainable groundwork to promote investments in the various regions of the country. \"In collaboration with DTI's regional offices, we have stepped up our promotion efforts to drive economic activities nationwide, especially in investment ready areas,\" DTI Undersecretary Ponciano Manalo, Jr. said. The BOI through its Domestic Investments Promotion Service and the Investment Assistance Service recently synchronized their respective programs to conduct the investment counseling and capability building training on investments promotion with focus on project plan preparation. \"With these efforts, we expect a more vibrant DTI and BOI presence in providing frontline services to investors in the regions,\" Manalo said. Manalo said the training intends to refine the skills of the DTI regional and provincial frontline staff and the Local Economic and Investment Promotion Officers (LEIPOs) assigned in the regional Negosyo Centers in assisting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and providing advanced advisory services on investments.  Business ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1   He added that project preparation skills of the stakeholders will be enriched to generate ready to go investment projects for promotion and possible BOI registration.

    "text": "THE government should invest in the country's information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure in order to democratize access to the Internet, Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino IV said Tuesday. \"If we do recognize that the Internet is important to our economy, it's important for the government to estimate how it could expand the scope of faster Internet in the country,\" Aquino told reporters after the Senate hearing on the impact of slow and expensive Internet connection. At the hearing, Mary Grace Santos of Internet Society noted that the Philippines lacked competition in terms of Internet service. Citing a study, Santos said the Philippines' Internet connection speed was second to the last in Asia Pacific in the first quarter of 2015. Santos urged the government to step up in terms of providing a \"carrier-neutral national backbone\" and also encouraging more competition in the market. National Economic and Development Authority Director General Arsenio Balisacan backed Santos' proposal and said the government has to do something to address the problem.  Balisacan warned the country would not be able to achieve a faster economic growth as he noted that ICT infrastructure is a \"major driver\" of the economy. Balisacan said the government should ensure that information, through Internet connection, would be accessible to the country's remote areas to make economic growth \"inclusive.\" In a survey released by the Department of Education in 2014, 83 percent of 38,000 elementary schools nationwide have no access to Internet, whether wired or wireless. But in many countries like Indonesia, Balisacan said elementary schools have almost full access to the Internet. \"(We) have to develop a very efficient tool in achieving effective growth (and) ICT is a powerful instrument for achieving inclusive growth,\" Balisacan said. \"ICT development shouldn't be left alone to the private sector. There must be a way to engage with the private sector so that we can make ICT access workable in the far-flung areas and the poorest of the poor.\" National Telecommunications Commissions Director Edgardo Cabarios, on the other hand, said they sought for the creation of an inter-agency body that will study ways for government to improve Internet speed and access.

    "text": "South Sudan's government on Tuesday slammed a peace proposal that they are under intense diplomatic pressure to sign after rebels agreed to the deal to end the country's brutal civil war. \"We strongly believe that this document cannot save the people of South Sudan,\" Information Minister Michael Makuei told reporters, as President Salva Kiir returned home from peace talks in Ethiopia. \"It is a sellout, and we will not accept it,\" Makuei said, adding the government would now discuss the deal with the people for 15 days. With diplomatic frustrations at breaking point over a conflict that has cost tens of thousands of lives, the international community had threatened possible sanctions if a deal was not reached by the end of Monday, urging the government to sign it. \"Failing to comply would entail consequences,\" the European Union said Tuesday, while the United States said Washington \"would consider ways to raise the cost for intransigence.\" Rebel chief Riek Machar signed the deal late Monday, calling on Kiir to join. - Rebel splits - But Kiir -- who watched the signing and briefly shook hands with Machar -- had warned from the start of talks that it would not be possible to sign a credible peace deal because rebel forces have split. \"We objected to it. There are disputed provisions and there are outstanding issues that need to be negotiated and agreed upon,\" said Makuei, head of the government delegation to the talks. \"If you -- people of South Sudan -- say that (we should) go and sign it, we will do so -- but I doubt if people will say so,\" Makuei added. Key issues of disagreement are understood to include details of a power-sharing proposal between the government and rebels, which could see Machar return as vice-president. But powerful rebel general Peter Gadet and other key commanders last week accused Machar of seeking power for himself, and said they would not recognise any deal agreed. The peace proposal has been put forward by the regional eight-nation bloc IGAD, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, as well as the United Nations, African Union, China and the \"troika\" of Britain, Norway and the United States. - 'Unimaginable destruction' - South Sudan's civil war erupted in December 2013 when Kiir accused his former deputy Machar of planning a coup, setting off a cycle of retaliatory killings that has split the poverty-stricken, landlocked country along ethnic lines. At least seven ceasefires have already been agreed and then shattered within days -- if not hours -- in the world's newest country, which broke away from Sudan in 2011. AU chief Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has warned the failure to strike an agreement \"will have far-reaching consequences for South Sudan, the region and the continent as a whole.\" In a signal of the dire conditions on the ground, the number sheltering inside UN peacekeeper bases has risen by a third in just over a month to almost 200,000 civilians, the UN mission said Monday. Marked by widespread atrocities on both sides, the war has been characterised by ethnic massacres and rape. Recent attacks have included castration, burning people alive and tying children together before slitting their throats. Aid agencies on Tuesday pleaded for a ceasefire to end the \"unimaginable destruction\", in a joint statement from Oxfam, CARE and the International Rescue Committee (IRC). \"Without peace, there will only be more fighting, more death,\" said Simon Chol Mialith from CARE. \"As a nation we are only four years old. I can only pray we will make it to five.\"",

    "text": "InterAksyon.com means BUSINESS MANILA - Uber has sought from the Philippine government a permit to operate as a public vehicle service provider. In a statement, Uber Technologies Inc on Monday said it filed with the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) an application to operate legally as a transport network company (TNC). \"We can confirm that Uber's application has been submitted and has been well received by the authorities,\" Laurence Cua, Uber general manager for Manila said. \"Since the beginning, Uber has always had one goal - to provide access to reliable, affordable and safe transportation options anytime and anywhere to all Filipinos at the push of a button and we look forward to the continued support and leadership of the government of the Philippines in achieving this,\" he said. Uber beat an August 20 deadline to apply for the franchise. The company's application comes after LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez warned that the agency starting August 21 would apprehend TNC vehicles if they failed to secure permits. Grab Car already sought government accreditation. Under Joint Administrative Order 2014-01, owners of private vehicles that operate as public utility vehicles (PUVs) will be fined P200,000 each and be impounded for three months. TNCs refer to organizations that provide pre-arranged transport services for compensation using an Internet-based technology application or a digital platform technology to connect passengers and drivers using their personal vehicles. Government accreditation would mean that TNCs will be required to meet vehicle eligibility standards, and to install global positioning system (GPS) tracking and navigation devices. TNC vehicles will be limited to passenger car sedans, Asian utility vehicles (AUV), sports utility vehicles (SUV), vans and similar vehicles. Such vehicles should be no older than seven years to qualify as PUVs.",

Romero, a senior member of the Regional Development Council, said that some of the programs under construction works. Among these are the Clark - Angeles - Magalang Road, Angeles City and the West Circumferential Road (Friendship Highway) Angeles City Section. Other plans for the TRIPPC in Central Luzon include the Lourdes - Clark Airbase Road, Tarlac, and the Pantabangan- Canili Bypass Road Aurora Province. Plans with direct impact on Pampanga tourism include the Aquino Byway - MNR (via San Jose Malino Anao Road and del Rosario Calulut San Fernando) and the Aquino Byway Manila North Road (via Mabalacat - Magalang Road). Romero said that once the road projects are fully realized, travelers and tourists will have easy access to different tourism destinations in Pampanga and Central Luzon. \"The quality and availability of road networks leading to tourism destinations have an effect on the overall tourism plans of the different provinces serviced by these projects,\" Romero said, adding that they are closely monitoring the developments of the road programs.

    "text": "MANILA, Philippines - MalacaÃ±ang gave assurance that all government agencies are prepared to address the El NiÃ±o and that President Aquino is closely monitoring the onslaught of the phenomenon in the country, particularly its effects on the agriculture sector as it may affect food production. \"Even before the recent news about the coming El NiÃ±o in September, the President has already been aware and he's already been briefed on the progress of El NiÃ±o,\" deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte said yesterday over radio dzRB. As part of government preparations, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) has already made projections. Valte noted that DOST's projections would guide other government agencies properly on the preparations that they would have to implement, such as cloud seeding and water preparation for irrigation. Other agencies should also be planning for their next steps with regard to the effects of El NiÃ±o although they already carried out similar measures last summer, when some areas in the country had less or zero rainfall, Valte added. El NiÃ±o can cause unusually heavy rains in some parts of the world and drought elsewhere. It began in March and is seen to last for a year.  Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1   Scientists of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center predicted that the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon that began this year could be \"among the strongest El NiÃ±os in the historical record dating back to 1950.\" Deputy director Mike Halpert said the average sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific could reach or exceed two degrees Celsius above normal, a phenomenon recorded only thrice in the last 65 years. For this reason, the government has widened and intensified its preparations. \"The situation is different from the time that we experienced that more than 15 years ago. Now, what is on our side...is that we have more lessons from then and there is more technology that can help aid in the solution,\" Valte said.",

    "text": "THE government through the Comprehensive Local Integration Program (Clip) has released P75,000 cash assistance to five former New People's Army (NPA) members in the province of Zamboanga del Sur. Zamboanga del Sur Governor Antonio Cerilles led the release of the cash assistance during the joint signing ceremony held on Wednesday, declaring the province as Peaceful and Ready for Further Development (PRFD). Cerilles, who is the Provincial Peace and Order Council chairman, sits as the committee chair of Clip in Zamboanga del Sur. Zamboanga del Sur provincial information officer Marivic Jongco said that each of the five former NPA rebels' beneficiaries received P15,000. The beneficiaries are the following: Domecino Bontilao, alias Ka Jerry; Christopher Rubio, alias Ka George and Justin; Jeson Colong, alias Ka Rexmar; Ramel Lumogos, alias Ka Ramz; and Raymond Sebastian, alias Ka Joseph. They belong to the different fronts of the NPA's Western Mindanao Regional Party Committee (WMRPC). Jongco said the Clip committee is processing the P50,000 livelihood project for the five beneficiaries as well as the remuneration of the firearms they turned over when they surrendered to the government. The rebel returnees will be also enrolled to various healing intervention to facilitate their integration into the society, said Jongco. Clip seeks to contribute toward achieving the goal of permanent and peaceful closure of all armed conflicts with non-state armed groups.

    "text": "IF Senator Grace Poe is as bright as I think she is, she should know by now that popularity is not all there is to it in winning elections. I say this because Grace has the mistaken notion that since she was No. 1 during the 2010 senatorial race, and that she is on top of pulse survey ratings, to the point of displacing Vice President Jejomar Binay, the former top pick of survey respondents, she now thinks she can be President. Poe's popularity is just one factor in her bid for the presidency. What matters most is grassroots political machinery. And this machinery must be well-oiled - meaning, money. It becomes worse when Grace thinks she can win the presidency as an independent without a political party. Santa Banana, Grace must be dreaming! We only have to take a look at history when popular presidential candidates lost, like Senator Miriam Santiago to less-popular Fidel V. Ramos in 1992, and Fernando Poe Jr. who lost to then-incumbent President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in 2004. Grace should be reminded of the adage that they who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it. * * * I'm glad that the Supreme Court finally granted a petition by detained Senator Juan Ponce Enrile to be given a Bill of Particulars or details of the case filed against him before the Sandiganbayan. This would enable the opposition senator and former Senate President to properly plead and prepare for his graft and plunder trial which has been going on for almost two years now. The law mandates that an accused must be given the right to seek a Bill of Particulars or details of the case filed against him as part of due process. To deny Enrile that right can only result in the miscarriage of justice. But, what is regrettable, to my mind, was the lack of time of the justices to rule on Enrile's petition for bail. Supreme Court insiders tell me that some justices said to be close to Malacanang have intentionally delayed Enrile's petition for bail, arguing that the justices had other priority cases pending in court. I am also told that some justices were absent during further hearings JPE's petition. Isn't Enrile's petition to be given bail important enough? The senator is already 91 going 92 years old and ailing. That's why he is detained at the Camp Crame Hospital. Due process and the rule of law demand that JPE's petition for bail must be prioritized. * * * Immediately after Senator Bongbong Marcos came out with his substitute bill on the Bangsamoro autonomy, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front appealed for Congress to restore no less than 28 provisions of the Bangsamoro Basic Law as contained in the draft bill submitted to Congress. The MILF also said that it cannot accept a watered- down version of the BBL. Otherwise, what? This to me is a veiled threat by the Moro rebels, that unless they cannot get what they want, they go back to war. Santa Banana, this is plain blackmail! What to me is rather surprising is that government peace negotiator Miriam Coronel Ferrer and Aquino Peace Adviser Teresita Deles are on the side of the Moro rebels. My gulay, aren't we taxpayers the ones paying them, not the MILF? Congress has the mandate to pass a law that conforms to the Constitution, not what the President wants, much less his subalterns like Ferrer and Deles. That's precisely why Senator Bongbong Marcos went on a consultation tour with all the stakeholders involved in the final peace and development of Mindanao to make the BBL inclusive. The original draft of the BBL involves only the MILF. If Bongbong's substitute bill did away with the unconstitutional provisions of the BBL, that's the way it should be. Otherwise, the BBL could be thumbed down by the Supreme Court as violative of the fundamental law of the land. The Senate could be blamed for it. Final peace and development in Mindanao should not be attained at all costs to favor only one stakeholder. If the House of Representatives with all the President's lapdogs and lackeys want to be dictated on by the MILF and the Aquino subalterns, let them. The Senate however should not allow this. * * * Last week, Trade Undersecretary Victor Dimagiba was on television as regular co-host of a consumer-oriented public affairs TV program when somebody from Laguna called to complain about the proliferation of substandard plywood and nails. Dimagiba said that he would look into the matter, this being a concern of the Bureau of Philippine Standards and the Consumer Protection Group, which he heads. Well, I have news for Usec Dimagiba. According to industry sources, the problem of substandard products has worsened after the BPS and the CPG, reportedly on his initiative, removed the five construction items from the DTI list of Products Under Mandatory Certification. This certification is a requirement for the issuance of Import Commodity Clearance before such products could be sold to the public. Aside from nails and plywood, the other delisted items are GI sheets, ceramic titles and flat glass. These were removed from the list purportedly because they are not \"life threatening.\" Not life threatening, Santa Banana! If the beams of a house collapse because the nails used are substandard, that is not life threatening? Or, if the GI sheets are easily blown away or easily get crumpled during a typhoon because of poor quality, does this not constitute a threat to the safety and lives of the occupants? Even flat glass can be dangerous when they easily break and the fragments hurt or even kill people. As for substandard tiles, how many people have suffered injuries or even died due to slippery, and probably low-quality tiles in their bathrooms? This is what happened recently to a long-time friend and fellow columnist from another newspaper. These products were exempted from mandatory certification, supposedly to speed up the processing of Import Commodity Clearances and make it easier for manufacturers, traders, importers and brokers to do business with the DTI. Those in the know claim that these GI sheets, plywood and tiles constitute the biggest volume of imports of construction items. In fact, manufacturers, traders and dealers of construction materials have been crying out against the unfair competition posed by these substandard products that are sold in the market at much cheaper prices. I am told that a Memorandum Order issued earlier this year, also by Dimagiba, allows the transfer or withdrawal of shipments from the warehouse even without prior notice to the Bureau of Philippine Standards, and even before these are tested and inspected by this agency. This is a clear violation of pertinent laws. Now is it true that some P4 billion worth of shipments have been transferred or withdrawn and distributed to various outlets nationwide? It seems that the DTI policies liberalizing the issuance of ICCs, the kid-glove treatment applied to those who withdraw shipments without prior notice to the BPS and the farcical issuance of show-cause orders have given the smugglers a wide avenue to continue their nefarious trade.",

    "content_html": "<p>IF Senator Grace Poe is as bright as I think she is, she should know by now that popularity is not all there is to it in winning elections.</p> <p>I say this because Grace has the mistaken notion that since she was No. 1 during the 2010 senatorial race, and that she is on top of pulse survey ratings, to the point of displacing Vice President Jejomar Binay, the former top pick of survey respondents, she now thinks she can be President.</p> <p>Poeâ€™s popularity is just one factor in her bid for the presidency. What matters most is grassroots political machinery. And this machinery must be well-oiled â€“ meaning, money.</p> <p>It becomes worse when Grace thinks she can win the presidency as an independent without a political party. Santa Banana, Grace must be dreaming!</p> <p>We only have to take a look at history when popular presidential candidates lost, like Senator Miriam Santiago to less-popular Fidel V. Ramos in 1992, and Fernando Poe Jr. who lost to then-incumbent President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in 2004.</p> <p>Grace should be reminded of the adage that they who donâ€™t learn from history are bound to repeat it.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Iâ€™m glad that the Supreme Court finally granted a petition by detained Senator Juan Ponce Enrile to be given a Bill of Particulars or details of the case filed against him before the Sandiganbayan. This would enable the opposition senator and former Senate President to properly plead and prepare for his graft and plunder trial which has been going on for almost two years now.</p> <p>The law mandates that an accused must be given the right to seek a Bill of Particulars or details of the case filed against him as part of due process. To deny Enrile that right can only result in the miscarriage of justice.</p> <p>But, what is regrettable, to my mind, was the lack of time of the justices to rule on Enrileâ€™s petition for bail. Supreme Court insiders tell me that some justices said to be close to Malacanang have intentionally delayed Enrileâ€™s petition for bail, arguing that the justices had other priority cases pending in court. I am also told that some justices were absent during further hearings JPEâ€™s petition. Isnâ€™t Enrileâ€™s petition to be given bail important enough?</p> <p>The senator is already 91 going 92 years old and ailing. Thatâ€™s why he is detained at the Camp Crame Hospital. Due process and the rule of law demand that JPEâ€™s petition for bail must be prioritized.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Immediately after Senator Bongbong Marcos came out with his substitute bill on the Bangsamoro autonomy, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front appealed for Congress to restore no less than 28 provisions of the Bangsamoro Basic Law as contained in the draft bill submitted to Congress.</p> <p>The MILF also said that it cannot accept a watered- down version of the BBL. Otherwise, what? This to me is a veiled threat by the Moro rebels, that unless they cannot get what they want, they go back to war. Santa Banana, this is plain blackmail!</p> <p>What to me is rather surprising is that government peace negotiator Miriam Coronel Ferrer and Aquino Peace Adviser Teresita Deles are on the side of the Moro rebels. My gulay, arenâ€™t we taxpayers the ones paying them, not the MILF?</p> <p>Congress has the mandate to pass a law that conforms to the Constitution, not what the President wants, much less his subalterns like Ferrer and Deles. Thatâ€™s precisely why Senator Bongbong Marcos went on a consultation tour with all the stakeholders involved in the final peace and development of Mindanao to make the BBL inclusive. The original draft of the BBL involves only the MILF.</p> <p>If Bongbongâ€™s substitute bill did away with the unconstitutional provisions of the BBL, thatâ€™s the way it should be. Otherwise, the BBL could be thumbed down by the Supreme Court as violative of the fundamental law of the land. The Senate could be blamed for it.</p> <p>Final peace and development in Mindanao should not be attained at all costs to favor only one stakeholder. If the House of Representatives with all the Presidentâ€™s lapdogs and lackeys want to be dictated on by the MILF and the Aquino subalterns, let them. The Senate however should not allow this.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Last week, Trade Undersecretary Victor Dimagiba was on television as regular co-host of a consumer-oriented public affairs TV program when somebody from Laguna called to complain about the proliferation of substandard plywood and nails.</p> <p>Dimagiba said that he would look into the matter, this being a concern of the Bureau of Philippine Standards and the Consumer Protection Group, which he heads.</p> <p>Well, I have news for Usec Dimagiba. According to industry sources, the problem of substandard products has worsened after the BPS and the CPG, reportedly on his initiative, removed the five construction items from the DTI list of Products Under Mandatory Certification.</p> <p>This certification is a requirement for the issuance of Import Commodity Clearance before such products could be sold to the public. Aside from nails and plywood, the other delisted items are GI sheets, ceramic titles and flat glass. These were removed from the list purportedly because they are not â€œlife threatening.â€</p> <p>Not life threatening, Santa Banana! If the beams of a house collapse because the nails used are substandard, that is not life threatening? Or, if the GI sheets are easily blown away or easily get crumpled during a typhoon because of poor quality, does this not constitute a threat to the safety and lives of the occupants? Even flat glass can be dangerous when they easily break and the fragments hurt or even kill people.</p> <p>As for substandard tiles, how many people have suffered injuries or even died due to slippery, and probably low-quality tiles in their bathrooms? This is what happened recently to a long-time friend and fellow columnist from another newspaper. These products were exempted from mandatory certification, supposedly to speed up the processing of Import Commodity Clearances and make it easier for manufacturers, traders, importers and brokers to do business with the DTI.</p> <p>Those in the know claim that these GI sheets, plywood and tiles constitute the biggest volume of imports of construction items. In fact, manufacturers, traders and dealers of construction materials have been crying out against the unfair competition posed by these substandard products that are sold in the market at much cheaper prices.</p> <p>I am told that a Memorandum Order issued earlier this year, also by Dimagiba, allows the transfer or withdrawal of shipments from the warehouse even without prior notice to the Bureau of Philippine Standards, and even before these are tested and inspected by this agency. This is a clear violation of pertinent laws.</p> <p>Now is it true that some P4 billion worth of shipments have been transferred or withdrawn and distributed to various outlets nationwide? It seems that the DTI policies liberalizing the issuance of ICCs, the kid-glove treatment applied to those who withdraw shipments without prior notice to the BPS and the farcical issuance of show-cause orders have given the smugglers a wide avenue to continue their nefarious trade.</p>"

    "text": "THE Office of the Vice President (OVP) was considered as the least performing government agency, according to the latest survey conducted by the Makati Business Club (MBC). MBC Executive Director Peter Perfecto said that among the 64 government agencies included in the survey, the OVP ranked 64th and one of the 24 agencies which received negative satisfaction rating. The OVP received satisfactory rating of 11.9 percent while 88.2 percent were dissatisfied or a net score of -76.3. Vice President Jejomar Binay has been accused of pocketing huge amount of money from questionable contracts when he was mayor of Makati City. Binay denied all the allegations. The Senate blue ribbon subcommittee has not yet ended its investigation on the alleged overpriced Makati City Hall Building 2 and Binay's alleged corrupt practices. It will resume its probe on August 20.  The MBC survey for the second semester of this year was conducted from July 6 to August 7 among the senior business executives. Some 67 corporations and other entities participated in the survey, representing 16.6 percent of MBC's 404 corporate members. Other agencies that landed at the bottom five were the Department of Transportation and Communications (-61.9), Bureau of Customs (-55.6), Department of Agriculture (-46.7), and the Energy Regulatory Commission (-42.4). Meanwhile, the top performing agencies that the MBC cited include the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (90.8), Philippine Economic Zone Authority (84.4), Department of Tourism (81.8), Department of Foreign Affairs (78.8) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (78.8).  The Office of the President ranked 27th with a net score of 29.0. The Second Semester 2015 MBC Executive Outlook Survey was administered via fax and online survey among MBC members.  Events that took place during the survey period were the Arbitral Tribunal of the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea commenced hearings on the territorial disputes in the West Philippine Sea; Police Director Ricardo Marquez formally took over as the chief of the Philippine National Police; President Benigno Aquino III delivered his sixth and final State of the Nation Address; and the President formally endorsed Local Government Secretary Manuel Roxas II as the administration's 2016 standard-bearer.

    "text": "Mindanao power consumer advocate Jojo Borja called us from the Energy Regulatory Commission hearing room. He couldn't wait for the proceedings to be over to vent his outrage. And it was not about the hearing but about an Aug. 11 PDI editorial on the \"Festering Power Problem\" in Mindanao. It blames the power crisis on two things: 1) the low water levels of the region's hydroelectric plants and 2) the need for \"bold steps to privatize the Agus-Pulangi power complexes to make these run more efficiently.\" The Inquirer claimed \"unreliable government-owned power complexes remain in the state's hands. If that happens, the story will always be the same for Mindanao: Demand for electricity for cooling will spike in the summer months, the regional supply grid will contend with low water levels to run the hydropower plants, and rotating outages will have to be undertaken to distribute the available supply... It is time to end this recurring story that has stunted the development of Mindanao... The government should take bold steps to privatize...\" Borja pointed to the flawed logic that the Inquirer was dishing out: \"If low water level is the problem how will privatization help? Even if the Agus-Pulangi is privatized but there is low or no water to run the turbines they still won't produce power. What will the private owners do, produce water by rain-dancing?\" But there is a logical explanation to the Inquirer's illogic. That paper has long been part of the manipulation of information by failing in the critical role of investigating and exposing the schemes of the oligarchy and its \"captive government.\" In the 2012 Mindanao power crisis, which by some estimates cost P60 billion pesos in losses for the island group's economy, pressure from the clamoring public and electricity consumer champions like Borja compelled the state-run National Power Corp. to fast-track the rehabilitation of the Pulangi IV hydroelectric plant in Bukidnon. That allowed the facility to generate its full installed capacity of 250 megawatts, instead of just half that figure before the rehab, which consisted of dredging the silt from the dam costing only P7.5 million. Expectedly, there were no more rehab works done after that under BS Aquino. That same year in 2012, Borja, while investigating the alleged \"water supply crisis\" affecting Mindanao's hydroelectric plants at the height of the \"shortage,\" saw and photographed these plants throwing away millions of gallons of water. We exposed this, too, on our GNN cable TV public interest program. The 2012 Mindanao power crisis has since been tided over by the rehab of Pulangi IV; so the question now is, why the rehab of the rest of the complex hasn't been done at all. The Agus-Pulangi has fully recovered its construction and financial investment costs. It produces electricity for only P0.20 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Yes, that's 20 centavos. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the foreign and local oligarchs are salivating for a takeover in order to sell the same electricity for a whopping P5 per kWh. Every passing administration (except Estrada's extremely short stint) neglected the maintenance and rehab of all the nation's hydroelectric plants that were yet to be privatized. The oligarchs, with their \"government capture\" getting ever tighter since Edsa I, are moving in on the Mindanao grid after gobbling the Luzon and Visayas grids in quick succession. Here's what they are most likely drooling over: Aside from hydroelectric plants, Mindanao has ample geothermal power plants constructed decades ago producing cheap power. The Epira or Electric Power Industry Reform Act that was passed in the previous decade mandates government to transfer all power generation and distribution functions (and assets) to private corporations. And so, the captured government has been busy privatizing geothermal power as well -- the latest being Mt. Apo Geothermal, where its power production capacity has been sold to a giant real estate company, which buys power at P3.00/kWh and sells it to electric cooperatives for a handsome P5.00/kWh without investing anything at all. The privatization of the electricity produced by Mt. Apo has raised the cost of living and production by 70 percent overnight; but the electric cooperatives and the consumers cannot do anything about it because Epira is the law. Can that law be changed in the future? I think it's more a question of should. Of course, if we are to survive as a democratic and prosperous people, we must change it.

    "content_html": "<p><strong>M</strong>indanao power consumer advocate Jojo Borja called us from the Energy Regulatory Commission hearing room. He couldnâ€™t wait for the proceedings to be over to vent his outrage. And it was not about the hearing but about an Aug. 11 PDI editorial on the â€œFestering Power Problemâ€ in Mindanao. It blames the power crisis on two things: 1) the low water levels of the regionâ€™s hydroelectric plants and 2) the need for â€œbold steps to privatize the Agus-Pulangi power complexes to make these run more efficiently.â€ The Inquirer claimed â€œunreliable government-owned power complexes remain in the stateâ€™s hands. If that happens, the story will always be the same for Mindanao: Demand for electricity for cooling will spike in the summer months, the regional supply grid will contend with low water levels to run the hydropower plants, and rotating outages will have to be undertaken to distribute the available supplyâ€¦ It is time to end this recurring story that has stunted the development of Mindanaoâ€¦ The government should take bold steps to privatizeâ€¦â€ Borja pointed to the flawed logic that the Inquirer was dishing out: â€œIf low water level is the problem how will privatization help? Even if the Agus-Pulangi is privatized but there is low or no water to run the turbines they still wonâ€™t produce power. What will the private owners do, produce water by rain-dancing?â€ But there is a logical explanation to the Inquirerâ€™s illogic. That paper has long been part of the manipulation of information by failing in the critical role of investigating and exposing the schemes of the oligarchy and its â€œcaptive government.â€ In the 2012 Mindanao power crisis, which by some estimates cost P60 billion pesos in losses for the island groupâ€™s economy, pressure from the clamoring public and electricity consumer champions like Borja compelled the state-run National Power Corp. to fast-track the rehabilitation of the Pulangi IV hydroelectric plant in Bukidnon. That allowed the facility to generate its full installed capacity of 250 megawatts, instead of just half that figure before the rehab, which consisted of dredging the silt from the dam costing only P7.5 million. Expectedly, there were no more rehab works done after that under BS Aquino. That same year in 2012, Borja, while investigating the alleged â€œwater supply crisisâ€ affecting Mindanaoâ€™s hydroelectric plants at the height of the â€œshortage,â€ saw and photographed these plants throwing away millions of gallons of water. We exposed this, too, on our GNN cable TV public interest program. The 2012 Mindanao power crisis has since been tided over by the rehab of Pulangi IV; so the question now is, why the rehab of the rest of the complex hasnâ€™t been done at all. The Agus-Pulangi has fully recovered its construction and financial investment costs. It produces electricity for only P0.20 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Yes, thatâ€™s 20 centavos. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the foreign and local oligarchs are salivating for a takeover in order to sell the same electricity for a whopping P5 per kWh. Every passing administration (except Estradaâ€™s extremely short stint) neglected the maintenance and rehab of all the nationâ€™s hydroelectric plants that were yet to be privatized. The oligarchs, with their â€œgovernment captureâ€ getting ever tighter since Edsa I, are moving in on the Mindanao grid after gobbling the Luzon and Visayas grids in quick succession. Hereâ€™s what they are most likely drooling over: Aside from hydroelectric plants, Mindanao has ample geothermal power plants constructed decades ago producing cheap power. The Epira or Electric Power Industry Reform Act that was passed in the previous decade mandates government to transfer all power generation and distribution functions (and assets) to private corporations. And so, the captured government has been busy privatizing geothermal power as well â€” the latest being Mt. Apo Geothermal, where its power production capacity has been sold to a giant real estate company, which buys power at P3.00/kWh and sells it to electric cooperatives for a handsome P5.00/kWh without investing anything at all. The privatization of the electricity produced by Mt. Apo has raised the cost of living and production by 70 percent overnight; but the electric cooperatives and the consumers cannot do anything about it because Epira is the law. Can that law be changed in the future? I think itâ€™s more a question of should. Of course, if we are to survive as a democratic and prosperous people, we must change it. Otherwise, we will all be impoverished by the power oligarchs. The Inquirer editorial referenced by Borja highlights the role of mainstream media (owned by the oligarchy) in using half-truths and outright lies, coordinated or otherwise with the powers behind the â€œcaptive government,â€ in hoodwinking the people. In a left-handed way such media give credence to the â€œwisdom of the people,â€ so much so that they, the tools of the oligarchy, have to resort to massive deceptions to get what their masters want, thereby putting mainstream media in the worst light.

    "text": "MANILA, Philippines - The government is hiring nearly 142,000 public school teachers and health workers this year and next year, Budget Secretary Florencio Abad said yesterday. He told the House appropriations committee chaired by Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab that there is P8.9 billion in this year's budget for the recruitment of 40,320 new teachers and P13.5 billion next year for an additional 62,320, for a total of 102,320 teaching personnel. The proposed P3.002-trillion national budget also allocates P61.8 billion for 43,000 new classrooms, P6.8 billion for computerization projects, P21.2 billion for assistance to students and teachers in private education and P4.2 billion for textbooks and instructional materials. The DBM has proposed a more than P111-billion increase in the budget of the Department of Education (DepEd) next year. Based on the National Expenditure Program (NEP) submitted to Congress, the DBM proposed a budget of P430.729 billion for DepEd next year, up from the current P319.231 billion. Education Secretary Armin Luistro said the huge increase was in preparation for the implementation of the K-to-12 program.  Headlines ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1   The STAR reviewed the latest NEP and compared it with the 2015 General Appropriations Act, the budget approved by Congress and President Aquino for the current year. Based on budget documents, DepEd will receive increases in personnel services, maintenance and other operating expenses and capital outlays.  P19.3 B for new positions On personal services, DBM proposed a budget of P19.322 billion for creation of new positions. No such line item was present in the previous year. According to Luistro, this includes budget for the creation of items for teaching and non-teaching personnel for senior high school. DepEd Assistant Secretary for programs and projects Elvin Uy said they proposed a budget for 43,000 teaching items even as DepEd only projects a need for 30,000 new teachers next year. \"That's in case we have a huge enrolment,\" he said. Uy said the budget proposal also includes funding for the creation of at least 6,000 non-teaching personnel for senior high schools. The bulk of the increase in the maintenance and other operating expenses is in the financial assistance and subsidy line item. From this year's P16.031-billion budget, it has ballooned to P28.782 billion in the proposed budget next year. Uy said the budget for financial subsidy is divided into three: 'education service contracting' that subsidizes the cost of tuition of students enrolled in private junior high school; subsidy for madaris or Muslim private schools; and for the voucher system for senior high school. The increase in the budget for financial subsidy is due to the first year of implementation of the voucher system for senior high school, which will subsidize the tuition of public Grade 10 graduates who will choose to enroll in private senior high schools. On capital outlay, the DBM proposed a budget of P80.067 billion for buildings and other structures, up from this year's P54.274-billion budget. On the other hand, DBM decreased the budget proposal for land outlay from this year's P400 million to P65 million next year. Another P3.439 billion is allotted for furniture, fixtures and books outlay, up from the current P1.246 billion. Luistro said the budget for school buildings would be for the construction of some 43,000 classrooms for Grade 12 students in June 2017. He said the budget for Grade 11 classrooms is already included in the 2014 and 2015 budgets. Reacting to criticisms that DepEd failed to utilize all of its budget allocations in the previous years, Luistro said it takes time to finish big projects like school buildings. He noted that construction of a four-storey building lasts at least nine months, and that it would be impossible to have finished all projects within the current year as there are bidding and other procedures to follow. He maintained that the government is on track in its building projects and that it would make sure that all teacher items for senior high school are filled before the start of classes in June 2016.  Health sector hiring In the health sector, Abad said that for this year, the government is hiring 13,500 nurses, 398 doctors, 3,100 midwives, 214 dentists, 787 public health workers and 308 medical technologists. For 2016, he said an additional 15,727 nurses would be hired, plus 946 doctors, 3,100 midwives, 324 dentists, 713 public health workers and 308 medical technologists. He added that P3.3 billion would be allocated for family health and responsible parenting programs, P1.1 billion for tuberculosis control and P793 million for treatment of public health diseases. Rep. Leah Paquiz of party-list Ang NARS appealed to Abad to raise the salary level of nurses in government hospitals from Salary Grade 11 (about P18,000 a month) to 15 (P25,000) as mandated by the Philippine Nurses Act of 2002. She said a special law like the one Congress had enacted for nurses should prevail over general legislation like the Salary Standardization Law for government personnel.",

    "text": "ONE of the supreme ironies of the Aquino administration's so-called straight path policy is that it cannot even keep the city trains running on track. By now, the public is well aware of the nightmare that is the MRT. We have seen trains run off the tracks or stall between stations, forcing thousands of weary passengers to trudge to the next stop. Long queues of suffering commuters must battle it out every day for a dwindling number of trains and cars, which are not even safe to run at full speed--the bitter fruit of years of gross mismanagement and neglect under managers that President Benigno Aquino III put in charge. Mr. Aquino likes to lay the blame on the previous administration and the MRT's private partners, but fails to answer one obvious question: Why is it that none of these problems made headlines before this President came to power? Why too, was the maintenance contract suddenly transferred from an internationally recognized and proven entity to a company whose only claim to fame was that it was owned by members of the President's Liberal Party? Up until now, the city's other major urban train line, the LRT, has been less problematic--but a Commission on Audit report completed in June signals trouble ahead on this front, too. The audit report showed that P1.314 billion that the administration allocated for the repair and maintenance of LRT 1 and 2 has already been released in full but has still not been used, delaying the delivery of improved railway services to the riding public. \"After more than a year since the fund was released, there was not a single significant accomplishment involving rehabilitation of System Lines 1 and 2,\" the report said. The COA also questioned the propriety of the decision of the Department of Transportation and Communications to engage in the procurement and bidding of the equipment needed for the repair, instead of the Light Rail Transit Authority, the implementing agency. The audit commission also questioned the DOTC's decision to allow the winning bidder not to submit pertinent documents required in the bidding process. A government that truly hewed to the straight path surely would not have allowed these audit exceptions in the LRT. Nor would it have allowed public funds to be so loosely squandered on what from all appearances was an anomalous maintenance contract in the MRT. While the President stubbornly refuses to take any of the responsibility for these failures, he should realize that Filipinos are not as gullible as he thinks.

We have seen trains run off the tracks or stall between stations, forcing thousands of weary passengers to trudge to the next stop. Long queues of suffering commuters must battle it out every day for a dwindling number of trains and cars, which are not even safe to run at full speedâ€”the bitter fruit of years of gross mismanagement and neglect under managers that President Benigno Aquino III put in charge.</p> <p>Mr. Aquino likes to lay the blame on the previous administration and the MRTâ€™s private partners, but fails to answer one obvious question: Why is it that none of these problems made headlines before this President came to power? Why too, was the maintenance contract suddenly transferred from an internationally recognized and proven entity to a company whose only claim to fame was that it was owned by members of the Presidentâ€™s Liberal Party?</p> <p>Up until now, the cityâ€™s other major urban train line, the LRT, has been less problematicâ€”but a Commission on Audit report completed in June signals trouble ahead on this front, too.</p> <p>The audit report showed that P1.314 billion that the administration allocated for the repair and maintenance of LRT 1 and 2 has already been released in full but has still not been used, delaying the delivery of improved railway services to the riding public.</p> <p>â€œAfter more than a year since the fund was released, there was not a single significant accomplishment involving rehabilitation of System Lines 1 and 2,â€ the report said.</p> <p>The COA also questioned the propriety of the decision of the Department of Transportation and Communications to engage in the procurement and bidding of the equipment needed for the repair, instead of the Light Rail Transit Authority, the implementing agency. The audit commission also questioned the DOTCâ€™s decision to allow the winning bidder not to submit pertinent documents required in the bidding process.</p> <p>A government that truly hewed to the straight path surely would not have allowed these audit exceptions in the LRT. Nor would it have allowed public funds to be so loosely squandered on what from all appearances was an anomalous maintenance contract in the MRT.</p> <p>While the President stubbornly refuses to take any of the responsibility for these failures, he should realize that Filipinos are not as gullible as he thinks. More than five years in power, Mr. Aquino and his minions in the Cabinet are running out of viable culprits to blame for the mess in our public transport system.</p>"

    "text": "(Part of Philippine Economic Report for 2014) Improve tax collection from conglomerates - IMF High income inequality is still widely prevalent in the Philippines and government must collect more taxes from the country's conglomerates to narrow the gap and boost revenues, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said. The Washington-based fund said the government has achieved progress on the fiscal front but still needs to improve tax administration, cut tax exemptions and broaden the tax base further to boost revenues. \"As we discussed, there are still issues related to inequality. There is still very high poverty. Those issues you need to tackle in the medium term,\" Naoyuki Shinohara, deputy managing director of IMF told The STAR in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on East Asia. While he lauded reforms and progress achieved on the fiscal front, he said the government must raise taxes slapped on conglomerates. \"I think what is important is to strengthen the tax administration, broaden the tax base by eliminating various exceptions. Get more cooperation from conglomerates. Tax administration needs to be stronger,\" he said. He said that generally, increasing income tax is better than relying mainly on value added tax (VAT). He also said the government must fight smuggling to plug revenue leakages. \"Your government is carrying out prudent fiscal policy. The budget deficit is under control. There's not much concern on that level,\" he said. The National Government fiscal deficit for the first month of 2014 stood at P34.2 billion, an indication of the government's increased spending for reconstruction and rehabilitation in the wake of recent natural disasters. This deficit is 75 percent or P14.7 billion higher than comparable January 2013 figures of P19.5 billion. The Bureau of Internal Revenue collected P104.2 billion in January 2014, higher by 10 percent compared to P94.7 billion in January 2013. Shinohara said the problem of high inequality is not exclusive to the Philippines as it is still prevalent across the region. Nevertheless, he lauded the government's Conditional Cash Transfer Program, saying that this is one measure by which countries could narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. \"We have started working on cash transfer mechanism. It's not an easy scheme. But it's a good measure to close the gap,\" he said. BOC misses April collection target The Bureau of Customs again missed its collection target for April 2014 with revenue reaching only P30.764 billion, short of the P35.793 billion goal for the month. Month of March 2014 revenue, however, was 13 percent higher than the collection recorded in the same month in 2013 due to \"continued process improvements, tighter watch over imports and import values of goods,\" the BOC said. The latest growth figure was slower than the 34 percent recorded in March 2014 and the 22 percent posted in February 2014. The agency said revenue growth slowed last month because of lesser number of working days--19 last month as against 21 in March--and the expanded truck ban imposed by the Manila local government. \"Revenue growth slowed down in April 2014 on account of less number of working days--at 19 versus 21 days in April 2013; as well as the implementation of the expanded truck ban in Manila, which affected collections in the Port of Manila and the Manila International Container Port, the country's largest customs ports in terms of volume,\" the BOC said. In the first four months of 2014, collections climbed 22 percent to P117.266 billion from the same period in 2013. The BOC has a P408-billion collection goal for 2014. PPA earnings up 50% in Q1 State-run Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) booked a 50 percent increase in earnings in the first quarter of 2014 amid the growing volume of cargo handled by ports nationwide. PPA general manager Juan Sta. Ana said the agency's net income amounted to P1.63 billion from January to March 2014 or P540 million higher compared to P1.09 billion in the same period in 2013. Sta. Ana said the earnings in the first quarter of 2014 exceeded the agency's income target of P960 million and is a testament that the measures being undertaken to reduce red tape and increase efficiency at the ports are effective. \"Simplifying requirements, reducing red tape and benchmarking Philippine port operations to world standards are giving huge positives to the agency,\" he stressed. Data showed that PPA's gross revenues grew 32.5 percent to P2.79 billion in the first quarter of 2014 from P2.1 billion in the same period in 2013. The amount exceeded the agency's target of P2.39 billion by 17 percent. Port revenues alone surged 34 percent to P2.77 billion from P2.07 billion. The agency's fund management income, however, fell 42 percent to P19.78 million due to increased operational spending resulting in lesser temporary idle cash available for use in short-term investments. Total expenses rose 15 percent to P1.16 billion as operating expenses inched up by P1.06 billion primarily due to the increase in the cost of administration and continued repair and maintenance projects. Non-operating expenses such as financial charges and gain or loss on of disposed assets grew 46.2 percent to P100.70 million due to guaranty fees on loans for the Batangas Port development project; interest expense on the P2-billion corporate notes; and interest expense on foreign loans, specifically the Batangas Port development project. \"With the bigger savings and higher financial flexibility, we can continue to upgrade port facilities nationwide as well as better efficiency that will eventually translate to better service to the travelling public and trade facilitation,\" Sta. Ana added. Cargo volume inched up close to five percent to 44.94 million metric tons from January to March 2014 compared to 42.942 million metric tons booked in the same period in 2013. Sta. Ana said the percentage of increase could have been higher if not for the day-time truck ban imposed by the city government of Manila that effectively constricts the Manila Ports to handle more cargo. It may be recalled that in February 2014, Manila imposed a day-time truck ban to ease vehicular traffic within the city. The local government only allows trucks to traverse city roads starting at 9 p.m. on top of the limited window for some truckers starting at 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sin tax collection hits P23.02 B in January-April The government surpassed its goal for excise tax collections on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products in the first four months of 2014, data from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) showed. Excise tax collections from all sin products amounted to P23.02 billion from January to April 2014, up 11.83 percent from P20.58 billion in the same period in 2013. The figure was higher than the bureau's P21.74-billion target for the period. BIR data showed excise tax collections from cigarettes went up 14.22 percent to P11.34 billion, exceeding the P10.85-billion goal. Those collected from fermented alcohol beverages climbed 7.23 percent to P7.66 billion, while excise tax raised from distilled spirits, meanwhile, jumped 14.43 percent to P4.014 billion. The collections on alcoholic beverages also breached the P10.89-billion target for the four-month period, BIR data showed. The Sin Tax Law, or RA 10351, took effect on January 1, 2013. This effectively raised the prices of alcohol and tobacco products to raise more revenues for the government. The law requires that 15 percent of the revenue collected from excise tax on tobacco products be used to enhance the livelihood of tobacco farmers across the country. The bulk or 80 percent of the remaining incremental revenues, meanwhile, are mandated to be used for the government's health care programs nationwide. Sin tax law effective in shoring up revenues - BIR The Bureau of Internal Revenue maintained that the sin tax reform law, which took effect early in 2013 has been effective in shoring up government revenues with the agency even exceeding its tax collection targets for cigarettes and alcohol. Internal Revenue Commissioner Kim Henares said six tax collections have improved since the implementation of the sin tax bill, which raised tax rates on alcoholic beverages and tobacco effective January 2013. Henares issued this statement following allegations that the government continued to lose massive revenues due to illicit tobacco trade in the country. According to a study commissioned by leading tobacco firm Philip Morris, the Philippines lost an estimated P15.6 billion in revenues because of non-payment of correct taxes by domestic cigarette manufacturers while the consumption of domestic illegal tobacco nearly tripled from 6.1 billion in 2012 to 17.1 billion in 2013. The report, done by Oxford Economic and International Tax and Investment Center, was designed to measure the consumption of illicit cigarettes - those sold in the domestic market but fail to comply with the right tax dues - in the Philippines and its impact on revenue losses for the government. The report found that 19.1 billion illicit cigarettes were consumed in the country in 2013, almost three times the estimated 6.4 billion illegally traded cigarettes used in 2012. Henares, however, dismissed this as a smear campaign aimed at undermining the credibility of the BIR. \"As far as we're concerned, we're doing okay. We're doing our job. I really don't care what they have to say because the figures show that the sin tax law has been effective in improving our revenue collections. In fact, we have been exceeding our six tax collection targets. Latest data from the BIR showed that excise tax collection on tobacco and alcoholic beverages reached P23.02 billion in the first four months of 2014 or 5.8 percent above the agency's P21.74-billion goal. The amount was also 11.83 percent higher than the P20.58 billion reported in the same period in 2013. Taxes from cigarettes amounted to P11.34 billion, up 14.22 percent from P9.93 billion. The amount likewise exceeded the P10.89 billion target. Collection of taxes from alcohol products likewise went up 9.29 percent to P11.64 billion. The amount was well above the P10.89 billion goal. The BIR expects sin tax collections to reach around P104.8 billion for 2014, P65.151 billion of which will come from cigarettes and P39.545 billion from alcoholic beverages. BIR misses collection target anew; P128.27B in revenue on May up 14.6% year-on-year Tax collections of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in the month of May 2014 grew at a double-digit rate, although still short of the agency's target. Data released on June 17 showed that the BIR collected P128.27 billion on May 2014, up 14.63 percent or P16.37 billion from its collection in the same month of 2013. Despite the double-digit year-on-year increase, the BIR's haul for May 2014 was 4.24-percent or P5.68 billion lower than the agency's collection goal of P133.95 billion for the month. Revenue from BIR operations jumped 14.57 percent to P125.46 billion on the month of May 2014, exceeding by P15.96 billion 2013's haul, but still 3.65-percent or P4.75-billion short of the P130.21-billion target. As for collection from non-BIR operations, the P2.81 billion posted on May 2014 was 17.42-percent or P417.07 million more year-on-year, although 24.92-percent or P933-million less than the P3.74-billion goal. Large taxpayers contributed P82.89 billion to May 2014's collections, which was 11.82-percent or P8.76 billion higher year-on-year. In May 2014 collections from large taxpayers, however, were 7.37-percent or P6.86 billion short of the target. Collection by the BIR's regional offices in May 2014, meanwhile, reached P42.58 billion, up 20.35 percent or P7.2 billion year-on-year. The regional offices' combined haul was only 0.6-percent or P257-million lower than their goal last month. Customs collections rise 11% in May but still short of target Reforms at the Bureau of Customs (BOC) continued to pay dividends as revenues for May 2014 rose by over a tenth, despite a drop in the value of goods imported by the country. Collections were still below the target for the month of May 2014, but officials remained optimistic, noting that the continued growth in revenues was a sign of more efficient operations. \"Looking beyond the revenue target, our collection efficiency is improving as we enhance our reference valuation figures and improve enforcement of customs policies and procedures, surveillance and apprehension of smuggled goods,\" BOC Commissioner John Philip Sevilla said in a statement. The BOC said collections were up 11 percent in May 2014, reaching P28.8 billion. This was 18 percent short of the target of P35.09 billion for the month, on the back of the reduced volume of importation. From January to May 2014, revenues were up by 20 percent year-on-year to P146.07-Billion.",

    "content_html": "<p><em>(Part of Philippine Economic Report for 2014)</em></p> <p><strong>Improve tax collection from conglomerates â€“ IMF</strong></p> <p>High income inequality is still widely prevalent in the Philippines and government must collect more taxes from the countryâ€™s conglomerates to narrow the gap and boost revenues, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said.</p> <p>The Washington-based fund said the government has achieved progress on the fiscal front but still needs to improve tax administration, cut tax exemptions and broaden the tax base further to boost revenues.</p> <p>â€œAs we discussed, there are still issues related to inequality. There is still very high poverty. Those issues you need to tackle in the medium term,â€ Naoyuki Shinohara, deputy managing director of IMF told The STAR in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on East Asia.</p> <p>While he lauded reforms and progress achieved on the fiscal front, he said the government must raise taxes slapped on conglomerates.</p> <p>â€œI think what is important is to strengthen the tax administration, broaden the tax base by eliminating various exceptions. Get more cooperation from conglomerates. Tax administration needs to be stronger,â€ he said.</p> <p>He said that generally, increasing income tax is better than relying mainly on value added tax (VAT).</p> <p>He also said the government must fight smuggling to plug revenue leakages.</p> <p>â€œYour government is carrying out prudent fiscal policy. The budget deficit is under control. Thereâ€™s not much concern on that level,â€ he said.</p> <p>The National Government fiscal deficit for the first month of 2014 stood at P34.2 billion, an indication of the governmentâ€™s increased spending for reconstruction and rehabilitation in the wake of recent natural disasters.</p> <p>This deficit is 75 percent or P14.7 billion higher than comparable January 2013 figures of P19.5 billion.</p> <p>The Bureau of Internal Revenue collected P104.2 billion in January 2014, higher by 10 percent compared to P94.7 billion in January 2013.</p> <p>Shinohara said the problem of high inequality is not exclusive to the Philippines as it is still prevalent across the region.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he lauded the governmentâ€™s Conditional Cash Transfer Program, saying that this is one measure by which countries could narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.</p> <p>â€œWe have started working on cash transfer mechanism. Itâ€™s not an easy scheme. But itâ€™s a good measure to close the gap,â€ he said.</p> <p><strong>BOC misses April collection target</strong></p> <p>The Bureau of Customs again missed its collection target for April 2014 with revenue reaching only P30.764 billion, short of the P35.793 billion goal for the month.</p> <p>Month of March 2014 revenue, however, was 13 percent higher than the collection recorded in the same month in 2013 due to â€œcontinued process improvements, tighter watch over imports and import values of goods,â€ the BOC said.</p> <p>The latest growth figure was slower than the 34 percent recorded in March 2014 and the 22 percent posted in February 2014.</p> <p>The agency said revenue growth slowed last month because of lesser number of working daysâ€”19 last month as against 21 in Marchâ€”and the expanded truck ban imposed by the Manila local government.</p> <p>â€œRevenue growth slowed down in April 2014 on account of less number of working daysâ€”at 19 versus 21 days in April 2013; as well as the implementation of the expanded truck ban in Manila, which affected collections in the Port of Manila and the Manila International Container Port, the countryâ€™s largest customs ports in terms of volume,â€ the BOC said.</p> <p>In the first four months of 2014, collections climbed 22 percent to P117.266 billion from the same period in 2013.</p> <p>The BOC has a P408-billion collection goal for 2014.</p> <p><strong>PPA earnings up 50% in Q1</strong></p> <p>State-run Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) booked a 50 percent increase in earnings in the first quarter of 2014 amid the growing volume of cargo handled by ports nationwide.</p> <p>PPA general manager Juan Sta. Ana said the agencyâ€™s net income amounted to P1.63 billion from January to March 2014 or P540 million higher compared to P1.09 billion in the same period in 2013.</p> <p>Sta. Ana said the earnings in the first quarter of 2014 exceeded the agencyâ€™s income target of P960 million and is a testament that the measures being undertaken to reduce red tape and increase efficiency at the ports are effective.</p> <p>â€œSimplifying requirements, reducing red tape and benchmarking Philippine port operations to world standards are giving huge positives to the agency,â€ he stressed.</p> <p>Data showed that PPAâ€™s gross revenues grew 32.5 percent to P2.79 billion in the first quarter of 2014 from P2.1 billion in the same period in 2013. The amount exceeded the agencyâ€™s target of P2.39 billion by 17 percent.</p> <p>Port revenues alone surged 34 percent to P2.77 billion from P2.07 billion.</p> <p>The agencyâ€™s fund management income, however, fell 42 percent to P19.78 million due to increased operational spending resulting in lesser temporary idle cash available for use in short-term investments.</p> <p>Total expenses rose 15 percent to P1.16 billion as operating expenses inched up by P1.06 billion primarily due to the increase in the cost of administration and continued repair and maintenance projects.</p> <p>Non-operating expenses such as financial charges and gain or loss on of disposed assets grew 46.2 percent to P100.70 million due to guaranty fees on loans for the Batangas Port development project; interest expense on the P2-billion corporate notes; and interest expense on foreign loans, specifically the Batangas Port development project.</p> <p>â€œWith the bigger savings and higher financial flexibility, we can continue to upgrade port facilities nationwide as well as better efficiency that will eventually translate to better service to the travelling public and trade facilitation,â€ Sta. Ana added.</p> <p>Cargo volume inched up close to five percent to 44.94 million metric tons from January to March 2014 compared to 42.942 million metric tons booked in the same period in 2013.</p> <p>Sta. Ana said the percentage of increase could have been higher if not for the day-time truck ban imposed by the city government of Manila that effectively constricts the Manila Ports to handle more cargo.</p> <p>It may be recalled that in February 2014, Manila imposed a day-time truck ban to ease vehicular traffic within the city. The local government only allows trucks to traverse city roads starting at 9 p.m. on top of the limited window for some truckers starting at 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p> <p><strong>Sin tax collection hits P23.02 B in January-April</strong></p> <p>The government surpassed its goal for excise tax collections on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products in the first four months of 2014, data from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) showed.</p> <p>Excise tax collections from all sin products amounted to P23.02 billion from January to April 2014, up 11.83 percent from P20.58 billion in the same period in 2013. The figure was higher than the bureauâ€™s P21.74-billion target for the period.</p> <p>BIR data showed excise tax collections from cigarettes went up 14.22 percent to P11.34 billion, exceeding the P10.85-billion goal.</p> <p>Those collected from fermented alcohol beverages climbed 7.23 percent to P7.66 billion, while excise tax raised from distilled spirits, meanwhile, jumped 14.43 percent to P4.014 billion.</p> <p>The collections on alcoholic beverages also breached the P10.89-billion target for the four-month period, BIR data showed.</p> <p>The Sin Tax Law, or RA 10351, took effect on January 1, 2013. This effectively raised the prices of alcohol and tobacco products to raise more revenues for the government.</p> <p>The law requires that 15 percent of the revenue collected from excise tax on tobacco products be used to enhance the livelihood of tobacco farmers across the country.</p> <p>The bulk or 80 percent of the remaining incremental revenues, meanwhile, are mandated to be used for the governmentâ€™s health care programs nationwide.</p> <p><strong>Sin tax law effective in shoring up revenues â€“ BIR</strong></p> <p>The Bureau of Internal Revenue maintained that the sin tax reform law, which took effect early in 2013 has been effective in shoring up government revenues with the agency even exceeding its tax collection targets for cigarettes and alcohol.</p> <p>Internal Revenue Commissioner Kim Henares said six tax collections have improved since the implementation of the sin tax bill, which raised tax rates on alcoholic beverages and tobacco effective January 2013.</p> <p>Henares issued this statement following allegations that the government continued to lose massive revenues due to illicit tobacco trade in the country.</p> <p>According to a study commissioned by leading tobacco firm Philip Morris, the Philippines lost an estimated P15.6 billion in revenues because of non-payment of correct taxes by domestic cigarette manufacturers while the consumption of domestic illegal tobacco nearly tripled from 6.1 billion in 2012 to 17.1 billion in 2013.</p> <p>The report, done by Oxford Economic and International Tax and Investment Center, was designed to measure the consumption of illicit cigarettes â€“ those sold in the domestic market but fail to comply with the right tax dues â€“ in the Philippines and its impact on revenue losses for the government.</p> <p>The report found that 19.1 billion illicit cigarettes were consumed in the country in 2013, almost three times the estimated 6.4 billion illegally traded cigarettes used in 2012.</p> <p>Henares, however, dismissed this as a smear campaign aimed at undermining the credibility of the BIR.</p> <p>â€œAs far as weâ€™re concerned, weâ€™re doing okay. Weâ€™re doing our job. I really donâ€™t care what they have to say because the figures show that the sin tax law has been effective in improving our revenue collections. In fact, we have been exceeding our six tax collection targets.</p> <p>Latest data from the BIR showed that excise tax collection on tobacco and alcoholic beverages reached P23.02 billion in the first four months of 2014 or 5.8 percent above the agencyâ€™s P21.74-billion goal. The amount was also 11.83 percent higher than the P20.58 billion reported in the same period in 2013.</p> <p>Taxes from cigarettes amounted to P11.34 billion, up 14.22 percent from P9.93 billion. The amount likewise exceeded the P10.89 billion target.</p> <p>Collection of taxes from alcohol products likewise went up 9.29 percent to P11.64 billion. The amount was well above the P10.89 billion goal.</p> <p>The BIR expects sin tax collections to reach around P104.8 billion for 2014, P65.151 billion of which will come from cigarettes and P39.545 billion from alcoholic beverages.</p> <p><strong>BIR misses collection target anew;</strong></p> <p><strong>P128.27B in revenue on May up 14.6% year-on-year</strong></p> <p>Tax collections of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in the month of May 2014 grew at a double-digit rate, although still short of the agencyâ€™s target.</p> <p>Data released on June 17 showed that the BIR collected P128.27 billion on May 2014, up 14.63 percent or P16.37 billion from its collection in the same month of 2013.</p> <p>Despite the double-digit year-on-year increase, the BIRâ€™s haul for May 2014 was 4.24-percent or P5.68 billion lower than the agencyâ€™s collection goal of P133.95 billion for the month.</p> <p>Revenue from BIR operations jumped 14.57 percent to P125.46 billion on the month of May 2014, exceeding by P15.96 billion 2013â€™s haul, but still 3.65-percent or P4.75-billion short of the P130.21-billion target.</p> <p>As for collection from non-BIR operations, the P2.81 billion posted on May 2014 was 17.42-percent or P417.07 million more year-on-year, although 24.92-percent or P933-million less than the P3.74-billion goal.</p> <p>Large taxpayers contributed P82.89 billion to May 2014â€™s collections, which was 11.82-percent or P8.76 billion higher year-on-year. In May 2014 collections from large taxpayers, however, were 7.37-percent or P6.86 billion short of the target.</p> <p>Collection by the BIRâ€™s regional offices in May 2014, meanwhile, reached P42.58 billion, up 20.35 percent or P7.2 billion year-on-year. The regional officesâ€™ combined haul was only 0.6-percent or P257-million lower than their goal last month.</p> <p><strong>Customs collections rise 11% in May but still short of target</strong></p> <p>Reforms at the Bureau of Customs (BOC) continued to pay dividends as revenues for May 2014 rose by over a tenth, despite a drop in the value of goods imported by the country.</p> <p>Collections were still below the target for the month of May 2014, but officials remained optimistic, noting that the continued growth in revenues was a sign of more efficient operations.</p> <p>â€œLooking beyond the revenue target, our collection efficiency is improving as we enhance our reference valuation figures and improve enforcement of customs policies and procedures, surveillance and apprehension of smuggled goods,â€ BOC Commissioner John Philip Sevilla said in a statement.</p> <p>The BOC said collections were up 11 percent in May 2014, reaching P28.8 billion. This was 18 percent short of the target of P35.09 billion for the month, on the back of the reduced volume of importation.</p> <p>From January to May 2014, revenues were up by 20 percent year-on-year to P146.07-Billion.</p>"

    "text": "THE 2016 executive budget of Zamboanga City is expected to reach more than P2 billion and higher than the budget this year. Zamboanga City's Finance Committee started Tuesday the marathon technical hearings in preparation for the finalization of the 2016 budget and its eventual submission to the City Council for approval.  City Government Information Officer Belen Sheila Covarrubias said the hearings set at the City Hall conference are expected to last for a week.  Covarrubias said that discussions during the first day of hearing centered on the requirements for maintenance and other operating expenses of the city's different national high schools, vocational technical schools, different levels of court, and different city departments including the Office of the City Mayor.  She said that security, health and education will continue to be the priority of the present administration.  The 2015 budget is P2.597 billion -- P168 million more than the previous budget of P2.429 nillion. Last June 10, Mayor Ma. Isabelle Climaco-Salazar convened the City Development Council where the body approved the City's P2.8 billion Annual Investment Plan. Prior to the marathon budget hearings, the City Finance committee also met with all the officials from the city's 98 villages for the barangay budget forum, also preparatory to the finalization of the 2016 budget.

    "text": "Councilor Caesar Distrito strongly opposed the approval of the ordinance naming the Bacolod Government Center (city hall) as The People's House of Bacolod City because it is illegal and contrary to law. Distrito said they might raise the matter before the Department of Justice (DOJ) or there might be other persons interested to question it since it did not obtain a unanimous vote. \"The Local Government Code provides that we can establish a Government Center, and this was stated in the deeds of donation, loan contracts, appropriation ordinances and other ordinances which recognize it as the Government Center.\" If the government center will be renamed, it should not be earlier than 10 years and this requires a unanimous vote based on section 13 of the Local Government Code. The structure has only existed for seven years, he said. Distrito said the comments, shares and likes that they received in social media only shows the overwhelming sentiments of the public that they are against the passage of the ordinance renaming the Bacolod Government Center as People's House. In fact, they received many petitions from thousands of signatories opposing the ordinance, with no one supportive of its passage. Thus, the voice of the people should be given utmost attention in considering this matter, Distrito added. The ordinance authored by Councilors Claudio Puentevella, Archie Baribar, Ana Marie Palermo, Sonya Verdeflor, Jocelle Batapa-Sigue, Wilson Gamboa, Jr. Alex Paglumotan, and Noli Villarosa, was passed on third and final reading by the Bacolod Sangguniang Panlungsod Wednesday. Those who objected to its passage were Councilors Em Legaspi-Ang, Roberto Rojas, Carlos Jose Lopez, El Cid Familiaran and Distrito.  Councilor Puentevella clarified that the newly-approved ordinance is not renaming of the edifice but giving it a name since it does not have one upon its completion in 2007. He also said the name 'new government center' was only given pursuant to Section 12 of the LCG to building constructed by a local government where administrative offices were housed. But there was no local ordinance or resolution to support the naming. The naming of the building will instill a sense of ownership, common pride and enduring identity to Bacolodnons as it is constructed at the expense of people's money, he pointed out. Distrito said the comments, shares and likes that they received in social media only shows the overwhelming sentiments of the public that they are against the passage of the ordinance renaming the Bacolod Government Center as People's House. In fact, they received many petitions from thousands of signatories opposing the ordinance, with no one supportive of its passage. Thus, the voice of the people should be given utmost attention in considering this matter, Distrito added. Puentevella further said, \"even the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, through its letter dated April 22, does not object to the naming of the edifice. The Department of Interior and Local Government has also manifested its support to the ordinance, saying that \"all government agencies and barangay officials must be notified properly.\" Paglumotan said the question involving the legality of the ordinance should be raised before the court. Only the Supreme Court can declare the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the measure. Since they are paying the loan incurred for the construction of the edifice from the taxes of the people, it is proper and fitting that it should be called the People's House, he said. Distrito said that since the construction of roads involves people's money, perhaps it should also be called people's road. China named their hall as People's Hall and their assembly as People's Assembly but look at their government. He said it is up to the DOJ to rule on the matter after the ordinance has been signed by the mayor because he believes questions will be raised.  It is the DOJ that can rule whether an ordinance is valid, constitutional or unconstitutional, like in the case of the new real property tax ordinance, Whether they will admit it or not this has become a political issue especially that elections is approaching. He hopes they respect the purpose of the past administration in establishing the government center for the people of Bacolod, the same way they hope that whatever projects the present administration will construct will also be respected in the future,\" Distrito disclosed. While Familiaran said, he was the one who drafted the ordinance last year and this was edited by Baribar. But after the first public hearing was conducted, he received many negative reactions so he withdrew his sponsorship and voted against the measure during its second reading, he said. He believes this will only intensify the animosity between Mayor Monico Puentevella and Bacolod Rep. Evelio Leonardia, Familiaran said. As representatives of the people they saw that the measure is divisive.  Ang recalled that dozens of cases had been filed against them because of the construction of the government center but these were later dismissed. She said during its passage, there are many other important things that deserve to be given attention and they have wasted so much time on an ordinance renaming the government center. \"*   Writer:    Edith Colmo     Negros Occidental :    Bacolod City    Archive: Monday, August 3, 2015",

Dr. Alumanda dela Rosa, PNRI director, said the US' Federal Register had already published the final rule approving the quarantine treatment of Philippine mangoes using gamma irradiation against the local mango pulp weevil . The approval has been certified by the USDA-Animal and Plant Heath Inspection Service-Center for Plant Health Science and Technology (ISDA-APHIS-CPHST). Dela Rosa said the PNRI was willing to hand over the quarantine treatment technology to the Department of Agriculture (DA) and any potential private sector partner to provide the quarantine treatment services to local mango growers and exporters. The irradiation facility, located in PNRI's compound in Quezon City, already has its hands full servicing the local spice industry requirements. \"The DA has already commissioned a feasibility study on setting up another irradiation facility,\" Dela Rosa told the Star in an interview.  Business ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1   The approval of the PNRI's quarantine treatment protocol using gamma irradiation will allow the Philippine carabao mango industry to export to the US and other big foreign markets which only accept \"super mangoes\" from Guimaras. \"Because right now, only Guimaras can export super mangoes (to the US). Now, we can export mangoes from other parts except Palawan which is already notorious for having mango pulp weevil,\" she said.",

    "text": "DID the Iloilo City government follow procurement rules in changing the location of traffic lights supplied and installed by Triune Electronics System? The question adds to the mystery surrounding the traffic lights deal on top of the P800,000 \"excess payment\" to Triune because of changes to its contracts. \"Change order\" was the reason proffered by the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) for the extra payment to Triune whose contract was only P13 million but was paid P14 million. In his letter dated February 4, 2014, Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog ordered the City Engineers Office (CEO) to move the traffic lights intended for Valeria-Delgado Streets in City Proper to Quezon-Delgado Streets. Mabilog cited Sections 43.1.1 to 43.1.3 of Republic Act 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act) as basis for the transfer. But Councilor Plaridel Nava, who instigated the probe into the traffic lights deal, said the provisions cited by Mabilog referred to Procurement of Domestic and Foreign Goods. A check by The Daily Guardian showed that the mayor should have cited is Rule XI Section 42 on Contract Implementation and Termination. TDG cannot immediately verify if the wrong citation was due to typographical error or plain carelessness. VARIATION ORDERS Nava said Mabilog ought to have cited Annex E of RA 9184 which refers to variation orders to a contract. The procuring entity may issue variation orders \"to cover any increase/decrease in quantities, including the introduction of new work items that are not included in the original contract or reclassification of work items that are either due to change of plans, design or alignment to suit actual field conditions.\" The changes in the design or plan must result \"in disparity between the preconstruction plans used for purposes of bidding and the 'as staked plans' or construction drawings prepared after a joint survey by the contractor and the Government. Variation orders can only be issued after award of the contract, provided that the cumulative amount of the changes does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the original project cost. The addition/deletion of works should be within the general scope of the project as bid and awarded. Variation orders come in two forms - change order and extra work order. Alfonso Bedonia, Department of Budget and Management (DBM) regional director, said a change order refers to changes to existing provisions of the program of works (POW) like quantity or kind of materials used in the project. \"If they will revise the program of works maybe due to the condition of the site or required materials, the procuring agency will issue change orders,\" Bedonia said. Extra work orders cover the introduction of new works not included in the POW and original contract but are necessary for the completion, improvement or protection of the project. Some of the conditions cited by RA 9184 which will necessitate extra work orders are \"subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site differing materially from those indicated in the contract, or where there are duly unknown physical conditions at the site of an unusual nature differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work or character provided for in the contract.\" Change and extra work orders must be funded by the same appropriation approved by the local legislative council or board. But if the budget comes from an entirely different source, if must be covered by another appropriation ordinance approved by the council or board. CHANGE LOCATION In the case of the traffic lights issue, the changes implemented by the executive department were on the locations of the gadgets. As stated earlier, traffic lights supplied by Triune for Valeria-Delgado Streets in City Proper were moved to Quezon-Delgado Streets. Similar changes were made in the contract of another supplier, KIV Marketing - traffic lights meant for the intersection of El 98-Libertad Streets in Jaro were transferred to El 98-Cuartero-Burgos Streets; and from the intersection of Bonifacio-Quezon-Yulo Drive in Arevalo to Gen. Luna-Mabini Streets Normally, appropriations for projects have specified locations but there are also cases when the executive is given leeway to decide on the site. Based on the documents obtained by TDG, the appropriation ordinance and resolution on the traffic lights did not provide specific locations where the signals will be installed. Bedonia said if this was the case, it appears that the City Council gave Mabilog leeway to decide on the project site. Bedonia added that if the procuring entity and the contractor agree, the location where the procured item will be installed can be modified during implementation. In his letter to the CEO, Mabilog cited bigger vehicle volume and high traffic density as the bases for moving the traffic lights to their present locations. But Nava questioned the basis saying the mayor ought to have cited a specific empirical study which influenced his decision.",

    "text": "TOKYO: The US spy agency targeted Japanese politicians, its top central banker and major firms for years, WikiLeaks said on Friday, in the latest revelations about Washington's snooping on allies. The intercepts exposing US National Security Agency activities follow other documents released by the whistleblower group that revealed spying on allies including Germany and France, straining relations. Japan is one of Washington's key allies in the Asia-Pacific region and they regularly consult on defense, economic and trade issues. The leaks comes as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe moves to expand the role of Japan's military, a move applauded by Washington but deeply unpopular at home. The claims of spying on trade officials could prove particularly sensitive after high-profile talks kicked off this week in Hawaii aimed at hammering out a vast free-trade bloc encompassing 40 percent of the world's economy. The United States, Japan, and 10 other Pacific Rim countries are looking to finalize the most ambitious trade deal in decades. But Washington and Tokyo--the biggest economies in the negotiations--have sparred over auto sector access and Tokyo's concerns about including agricultural products in the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. \"The reports demonstrate the depth of US surveillance of the Japanese government, indicating that intelligence was gathered and processed from numerous Japanese government ministries and offices,\" WikiLeaks said. There was \"intimate knowledge of internal Japanese deliberations\" on trade issues, nuclear policy, and Tokyo's diplomatic relations with Washington, it said. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did not appear to be a direct target of wiretapping but senior politicians were, including Trade Minister Yoichi Miyazawa, while Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda was also in the sights of US intelligence, WikiLeaks said. Tokyo did not immediately react to the leaked documents. The spying goes back at least as far as Abe's brief first term, which began in 2006, WikiLeaks said. Abe swept to power again in late 2012. \"If this is true, Japan is going to be asking for an explanation from the US side, but it's unlikely to have a major impact on the core of Japan-US relations,\" said Yoshinobu Yamamoto, a professor of international politics at the University of Niigata Prefecture. The leaks may provoke a strong reaction from a public wary of Abe's bid to expand the military's role and push through a trade deal strongly opposed by Japan's politically powerful farm lobby. \"I think some interest groups and opposition parties will use this news to stick a spoke in the government's wheel,\" said Celine Pajon, a Japan specialist at the French Institute of International Relations. Japanese lawmakers are debating the controversial bills that would expand the role of the military and could possibly see troops fighting abroad in defence of allies--chiefly the United States--for the first time since the end of World War II. Abe, stressing the Japan-US alliance as the cornerstone of its diplomacy, wants to enact the bills soon, but opponents say they will drag officially pacifist Japan into foreign wars. WikiLeaks said there were also intercepts about \"sensitive climate change strategy\" and the \"content of a confidential prime ministerial briefing that took place at Shinzo Abe's official residence\". One intercepted communication suggested Japanese agriculture ministry officials were alarmed at a possible backlash from Washington over a delay in importing US cherries. Trading giant Mitsubishi's natural gas division and Mitsui's petroleum unit were targeted, while four reports were classified as \"Top Secret\". One report was marked to indicate it could be released to allies Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. \"In these documents we see the Japanese government worrying in private about how much or how little to tell the United States, in order to prevent undermining of its climate change proposal or its diplomatic relationship,\" WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange said in a statement. \"And yet we now know that the United States heard everything and read everything, and was passing around the deliberations of Japanese leadership to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK.\"",

Abe swept to power again in late 2012.</p> <p>â€œIf this is true, Japan is going to be asking for an explanation from the US side, but itâ€™s unlikely to have a major impact on the core of Japan-US relations,â€ said Yoshinobu Yamamoto, a professor of international politics at the University of Niigata Prefecture.</p> <p>The leaks may provoke a strong reaction from a public wary of Abeâ€™s bid to expand the militaryâ€™s role and push through a trade deal strongly opposed by Japanâ€™s politically powerful farm lobby.</p> <p>â€œI think some interest groups and opposition parties will use this news to stick a spoke in the governmentâ€™s wheel,â€ said Celine Pajon, a Japan specialist at the French Institute of International Relations.</p> <p>Japanese lawmakers are debating the controversial bills that would expand the role of the military and could possibly see troops fighting abroad in defence of alliesâ€”chiefly the United Statesâ€”for the first time since the end of World War II.</p> <p>Abe, stressing the Japan-US alliance as the cornerstone of its diplomacy, wants to enact the bills soon, but opponents say they will drag officially pacifist Japan into foreign wars.</p> <p>WikiLeaks said there were also intercepts about â€œsensitive climate change strategyâ€ and the â€œcontent of a confidential prime ministerial briefing that took place at Shinzo Abeâ€™s official residenceâ€.</p> <p>One intercepted communication suggested Japanese agriculture ministry officials were alarmed at a possible backlash from Washington over a delay in importing US cherries.</p> <p>Trading giant Mitsubishiâ€™s natural gas division and Mitsuiâ€™s petroleum unit were targeted, while four reports were classified as â€œTop Secretâ€.</p> <p>One report was marked to indicate it could be released to allies Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.</p> <p>â€œIn these documents we see the Japanese government worrying in private about how much or how little to tell the United States, in order to prevent undermining of its climate change proposal or its diplomatic relationship,â€ WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange said in a statement.</p> <p>â€œAnd yet we now know that the United States heard everything and read everything, and was passing around the deliberations of Japanese leadership to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK.â€</p> </div>"

    "text": "MANILA, Philippines - The government will ramp up public spending on infrastructure next year to sustain the country's growth momentum, data from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) showed. Under the proposed P3.002-trillion national budget for 2016, the government aims to spend P766.5 billion for public infrastructure, nearly 35 percent higher than this year's allocation of P569.9 billion. According to the DBM data, next year's budget allocation is about five percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and more than four times the P165 billion infrastructure spending by the government in 2010. \"We implemented bold reforms to ensure that we spend on the right projects at the right cost and with the right quality,\" President Aquino said in his budget message following the submission of the proposed 2016 national budget to Congress. The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) accounted for the lion's share of infrastructure budget with P268.4 billion for the pavement of national roads and construction of access roads to airports, seaports, and tourist destinations. Allocations for the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) amounted to P10.2 billion for the construction and improvement of airports and seaports, and P15.7 billion for the rehabilitation of railway systems. \"In addition to infrastructure, this budget invests in strategic support services to boost agriculture, revitalize the manufacturing sector, and further expand the tourism industry,\" Aquino said. Budget allocation for the Department of Agriculture stood at P93.4 billion for the construction of more farm-to-market roads and irrigation services, and provide for services that will help farmers diversify their crops and reach the right markets. The Department of Agrarian Reform's budget stood at P4.5 billion for the acquisition and distribution of covered lands to beneficiaries. DBM data also showed the government plans to continue supporting the manufacturing sector next year with P10.6 billion set aside for technical-vocational and tertiary education scholarships to enhance the quality of the workforce. Another P780 million has been earmarked for the Small Enterprise Technology Upgrading program for 2,150 small and medium enterprises, while P201 million has been appropriated for the creation of 68 Negosyo Centers to assist SMEs. At the same time, the government allotted P24 billion for additional infrastructure to make tourism destinations more accessible under the proposed 2016 budget, while budget for tourism promotion stood at P4.3 billion.

    "text": "by FRANCISCO S. TATAD   When I was growing up on the faraway Pacific island of Catanduanes, I used to spend moonlit evenings at the town plaza listening to campaign speeches. There was nothing else to listen to or watch, and the \"orators,\" as they were called, were uniformly good. From them, I first heard quotes from Alexander the Great, Caesar, Cicero and Demosthenes. One of them particularly stood out. He seemed quite ordinary, but his entire personality changed the minute he spoke. And he told the most astonishing stories. The crowd loved him and he always got their votes. But one day one brash young man stood up to say this political Chrysostom had never kept a single promise he had made. That arrow went home, and the poor fellow threatened to disintegrate. He must have felt like the Emperor whom the little boy with the big mouth said was naked as a fish after everyone else had fawned over his imaginary robe of gold. But before he went down, he said: \"You accuse me of telling lies just because I tell you stories. At least, you have not accused me of telling the truth. I thank you for that. But the trouble here, my dear people, is that you think you have to believe everything I say when not even I believe it myself.\" This is probably what President B. S. Aquino 3rd should have told us, his critics, after his sixth and final State of the Nation Address. Far too many have accused him of hosting a banquet of lies. What else did we expect? A government nourished on lies will only produce a bumper crop of lies. As Chesterton said, a donkey will always be successful in being a donkey. We always get the government and \"leaders\" we deserve. Indeed, it's all our fault. PNoy never claimed to be anything other than what he is, but many tried to turn him into something he wasn't. And no one, not even his political adversaries, ever exercised what in business is called \"due diligence.\" Nobody found it necessary to trace PNoy's pedigree back to his paternal grandfather at least, just to find out how the new generation felt about electing the untested grandson of a man who collaborated with the Japanese during the war, but escaped being prosecuted for treason only by dying while watching a boxing match at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. And nobody insisted on requiring all presidential candidates to submit to a psychological and psychiatric examination, just to find out if PNoy's alleged psychiatric record, coming from two Jesuit psychiatrists, had any element of truth in it. Many, if not most of us, were content to listen to the nonsense coming from otherwise sensible and intelligent people when PNoy first announced his presidential bid. He had done nothing at all to merit even his previous lower posts, but there he was, being packaged for the highest and most important post, just because his mother died. His most enthusiastic promoters gushed like the untamed cataracts at the Niagara Falls. As the only son of the late Ninoy and Cory Aquino, they said, he would not do anything to tarnish his \"parent's image and record.\" It was a blind leap of faith, based on purely illusory and wishful premises rather than on any revealed or discernible truth. He had served three consecutive terms in the House and three years in the Senate, and had failed to distinguish himself except as a member of the Committee on Silence. So he had to run on his parents' record. But what kind of record was that? It wasn't much either. His mother's presidency was a complete failure. She was the biggest beneficiary of the \"restoration\" of the Philippines' free-wheeling democracy after Marcos, but her official propagandists and revisionists of the nation's history claimed she single-handedly \"restored Philippine democracy\" even though she hid inside a convent in Cebu while the military and the masses marched on EDSA in Manila to oust Marcos. As president, she caused unprecedented power blackouts by abolishing the government's far-seeing energy program (for no other reason than that it reminded the people of Marcos); messed up land reform by exempting Hacienda Luisita, her own family's sugar plantation, from its coverage, and legalized various forms of gambling opposed by all the churches in the Philippines. As for his father Ninoy Aquino, his polemical skills passed unequalled among his peers, but as a senator of the realm he is remembered (perhaps unfairly) for only one piece of legislation, the Study Now, Pay Later Law for poor students. It was a good law, but many years later, when Ninoy's former chief of staff ran for senator himself, he included in his resume a statement saying he was the one who drafted that particular legislation. There was no reason to doubt that claim, but it divested Ninoy of his only known contribution to lawmaking. But he was tireless as a speaker. One famous Ninoy Aquino speech created the persistent myth about the so-called Jabidah \"massacre\" of alleged Muslim recruits on Corregidor island. Unlike the Jan. 25, 2015 massacre in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, where 44 Special Action Force police commandos perished in the hands of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters after they were denied reinforcement, no riddled bodies of alleged massacre victims were found on Corregidor. And no widows or orphans ever surfaced to demand justice for their loved ones. In fact, Ninoy questioned the veracity of the alleged massacre, saying he had seen and talked to the alleged victims in Jolo himself. But Ninoy exposed Marcos' secret plan to send Filipino operatives to Sabah, which has become part of the Philippines' national territory (although controlled by Malaysia), by virtue of the transfer of sovereign rights from its original owner, the Sultan of Sulu, to the Republic of the Philippines. This single episode made Aquino an \"enemy of the state,\" as far as the Marcos regime was concerned. Aquino was assassinated in 1983, and that remains a deep mystery; but the greater mystery is why Cory Aquino and her son PNoy never bothered to have it thoroughly investigated to this very day. In the last five years, PNoy has subsisted on pure drivel, bluff and braggadocio. Called to sum up his \"achievements\" during his final SONA, he was forced to invent and manufacture what did not exist, and to portray illusion as reality. But not all is lost. Between now and the May 2016 elections, he could still achieve something meaningful for himself and for the country, if he puts his mind to it and rejects all temptations to rig the elections to ensure his party's and his candidates' \"victory.\" As titular head of the Liberal Party, he is expected to endorse or proclaim DILG Secretary Mar Roxas as the LP standard-bearer. Let that be his last partisan act in the run-up to, and during the entire 2016 election. Let him henceforth devote all his time, talent, energy and resources to ensuring a truly clean, honest and credible election, and let the entire nation and the world marvel at that. If Mar Roxas wins in such an election, it would be a double win for him as President. If Mar Roxas loses, it would still be a victory for him as the author of a genuinely clean, honest and credible election. He hasn't got anything he has not received, and he owes it to his God and to his people. Let him now try to modify the paradigm a little bit, by making the present and the next generations owe him a real chance to have a true democracy by means of a clean, honest and credible election. In brushing aside Sen. Grace Poe Llamanzares's indecent attempts to insinuate herself into the presidential contest, for which she is constitutionally disqualified, and in choosing to honor a party commitment to Roxas, despite his reputedly poor survey ratings, PNoy has taken a mature political decision, which has been long in coming. These are actually two decisions in one. The first involves the primacy and inviolability of the Constitution; the second involves the integrity of the political choosing process. Until now, Sen. Llamanzares and her supporters have completely ignored Section 2, Article IV of the 1987 Constitution, which provides, \"No person may be elected President unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election.\" This is probably because she has managed to remain in the Senate despite her similar constitutional disqualification to run and be \"elected\" as senator. I have, on my own, more than sufficiently demonstrated in this space that Llamanzares is not a natural-born Filipino citizen by any stretch of the imagination, nor a Philippine resident for the last ten years immediately preceding the election. Therefore she is not qualified to even daydream of running for president or vice-president. But instead of saying my objection is pure nonsense, her promoters talk of Llamanzares as a possible presidential candidate, as though the Constitution did not exist, just because some skewed surveys have put her above others in some simulated popularity ratings. In refusing to be deceived by her posturings, PNoy did not have to tell Llamanzares and her promoters to read the 1935 and the 1987 Constitutions. But it would be a signal service to the nation, if he would tell them now. The 1935 Constitution was the one in force and in effect when Llamanzares was born in 1968 and found by a church worker in Jaro, Iloilo as a foundling. The 1987 Constitution governs the present conduct of our senatorial and presidential elections. The other issue has to do with popularity ratings. In choosing Roxas to be the LP standard-bearer despite his poor numbers, PNoy correctly decided that the party, not the propaganda fraudsters, should choose the standard-bearer. Political parties must field candidates who deserve to be elected, not just those who could win. Thereafter, the parties have to exert every effort to make their candidates win. This is how it works in mature political systems. I am not at all arguing for Roxas, but if the choice of Roxas as LP standard bearer means throwing out the propaganda fraudsters, then it means there's still hope for the future. fstatad@gmail.com",

    "content_html": "<div> <div> <p>by <a href=\"http://whlnk.com/eU7\">FRANCISCO S. TATAD </a></p> </div> <p>When I was growing up on the faraway Pacific island of Catanduanes, I used to spend moonlit evenings at the town plaza listening to campaign speeches. There was nothing else to listen to or watch, and the â€œorators,â€ as they were called, were uniformly good. From them, I first heard quotes from Alexander the Great, Caesar, Cicero and Demosthenes. One of them particularly stood out. He seemed quite ordinary, but his entire personality changed the minute he spoke. And he told the most astonishing stories. The crowd loved him and he always got their votes. But one day one brash young man stood up to say this political Chrysostom had never kept a single promise he had made.</p> <p>That arrow went home, and the poor fellow threatened to disintegrate. He must have felt like the Emperor whom the little boy with the big mouth said was naked as a fish after everyone else had fawned over his imaginary robe of gold. But before he went down, he said: â€œYou accuse me of telling lies just because I tell you stories. At least, you have not accused me of telling the truth. I thank you for that. But the trouble here, my dear people, is that you think you have to believe everything I say when not even I believe it myself.â€</p> <p>This is probably what President B. S. Aquino 3rd should have told us, his critics, after his sixth and final State of the Nation Address. Far too many have accused him of hosting a banquet of lies. What else did we expect? A government nourished on lies will only produce a bumper crop of lies. As Chesterton said, a donkey will always be successful in being a donkey. We always get the government and â€œleadersâ€ we deserve.</p> <p>Indeed, itâ€™s all our fault. PNoy never claimed to be anything other than what he is, but many tried to turn him into something he wasnâ€™t. And no one, not even his political adversaries, ever exercised what in business is called â€œdue diligence.â€ Nobody found it necessary to trace PNoyâ€™s pedigree back to his paternal grandfather at least, just to find out how the new generation felt about electing the untested grandson of a man who collaborated with the Japanese during the war, but escaped being prosecuted for treason only by dying while watching a boxing match at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. And nobody insisted on requiring all presidential candidates to submit to a psychological and psychiatric examination, just to find out if PNoyâ€™s alleged psychiatric record, coming from two Jesuit psychiatrists, had any element of truth in it.</p> <p>Many, if not most of us, were content to listen to the nonsense coming from otherwise sensible and intelligent people when PNoy first announced his presidential bid. He had done nothing at all to merit even his previous lower posts, but there he was, being packaged for the highest and most important post, just because his mother died. His most enthusiastic promoters gushed like the untamed cataracts at the Niagara Falls. As the only son of the late Ninoy and Cory Aquino, they said, he would not do anything to tarnish his â€œparentâ€™s image and record.â€</p> <p>It was a blind leap of faith, based on purely illusory and wishful premises rather than on any revealed or discernible truth. He had served three consecutive terms in the House and three years in the Senate, and had failed to distinguish himself except as a member of the Committee on Silence. So he had to run on his parentsâ€™ record. But what kind of record was that?</p> <p>It wasnâ€™t much either. His motherâ€™s presidency was a complete failure. She was the biggest beneficiary of the â€œrestorationâ€ of the Philippinesâ€™ free-wheeling democracy after Marcos, but her official propagandists and revisionists of the nationâ€™s history claimed she single-handedly â€œrestored Philippine democracyâ€ even though she hid inside a convent in Cebu while the military and the masses marched on EDSA in Manila to oust Marcos.</p> <p>As president, she caused unprecedented power blackouts by abolishing the governmentâ€™s far-seeing energy program (for no other reason than that it reminded the people of Marcos); messed up land reform by exempting Hacienda Luisita, her own familyâ€™s sugar plantation, from its coverage, and legalized various forms of gambling opposed by all the churches in the Philippines.</p> <p>As for his father Ninoy Aquino, his polemical skills passed unequalled among his peers, but as a senator of the realm he is remembered (perhaps unfairly) for only one piece of legislation, the Study Now, Pay Later Law for poor students.

    "text": "The US spied on senior Japanese politicians, its top central banker and major companies including conglomerate Mitsubishi, according to documents released Friday by WikiLeaks, which published a list of at least 35 targets. The latest claim of US National Security Agency espionage follows other documents that showed snooping on allies including Germany and France. There is no specific mention of wiretapping Prime Minister Shinzo Abe but senior members of his government, including Trade Minister Yoichi Miyazawa and Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda were targets of the bugging by US intelligence, WikiLeaks said. Japan is one of Washington's key allies in the Asia-Pacific region and they regularly consult on defense, economic and trade issues. The spying goes back at least as far as Abe's brief first term, which began in 2006, WikiLeaks said. Abe swept to power again in late 2012. \"The reports demonstrate the depth of US surveillance of the Japanese government, indicating that intelligence was gathered and processed from numerous Japanese government ministries and offices,\" it said. \"The documents demonstrate intimate knowledge of internal Japanese deliberations\" on trade issues, nuclear and climate change policy, among others, it added. There was no immediate reaction from Tokyo on the documents released by WikiLeaks.",

    "text": "(Part of Philippine Economic Report for 2014) What is government revenue? Government revenues are primarily being referred to as - taxes. The best examples of government revenue are taxes collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and the Customs' duties and taxes collected by the Bureau of Customs. Quite often, funds that were generated by government instrumentalities from payments of \"permit fees\" are likewise categorized as \"revenues\". And so with the \"shares\" from income of government owned or controlled corporations, for instance - Pagcor. It is also notable to mention here that the government also receives shares from the payment of \"royalties\", collected from the income and proceeds of Malampaya Gas Exploration and other similar big stake government projects. And lest we forget, the government's income from the \"leases\" of its properties. These revenues will provide the government the funds that are much needed in its operation to promote the general welfare and well-being of its citizenry. In my recent study about taxes and development, I had the opportunity to read the 12-page research paper, prepared by Keith Patterson of the Tax and Development Programme of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Patterson said that tax revenues provide governments with the funds they need to invest in development, relieve poverty, deliver public services and build the physical and social infrastructure for long-term growth. However, the same OECD study has also observed that many developing countries face challenges in increasing their revenue from domestic sources. These challenges include a small tax base, a large informal sector, weak governance and administrative capacity, low levels of per capita income, domestic savings and investment and possibly tax avoidance by elites. Without much ado, let us talk about \"government revenues.\" In the process, we will have the opportunity to know firsthand what transpired in our government's effort to generate the revenues for the much needed development and in the building of physical and social infrastructure for long-term growth. Gov't tax effort improves to 13.4% The Aquino administration's tax effort is seen to have improved by half a basis point in 2013 to 13.4 percent, mainly due to robust collections by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Department of Finance (DOF) reported on January 7 (2014). Tax effort measures the government's efficiency in collecting taxes and is computed by dividing collections into the country's total economic output. 2013's revenue effort was just .1 basis point shy of the government's goal of 13.5 percent. The BIR, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the government's total revenues, is seen to have increased its tax effort to 10.5 percent or a little over its target of 10.6 percent as a result of the sin tax reform law, which imposed higher taxes on tobacco and alcoholic beverages beginning January 2013. The agency's intensified campaign against tax evaders was likewise attributed to BIR's higher tax revenues. Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima believes that the BIR still has room for growth in terms of collecting taxes given the billions of pesos in foregone revenues due to tax evasion. An estimate by various groups puts Philippines' losses from tax evasion at P380 billion to P450 billion a year. Non-payment of taxes and under declaration of incomes among self-employed professionals and individuals remain a problem by the government. The Bureau of Customs' tax effort, on the other hand, was seen to have settled at 2.7 percent, roughly the same level as 2013. The agency, however, missed its 2013 tax collection goal of 2.9 percent. The government's role is to shore up tax effort to a record 16 percent before the end of President Aquino's term in 2016. The BIR was tasked to collect P1.25 trillion in 2013, 17.6 percent higher than the previous year's collection. In the 11 months to November 2013, the agency collected P1.12 trillion, already exceeding total collections for the whole of 2012. BIR sets P1.46-T target for 2014 The Bureau of Internal Revenue is eyeing P1.46 trillion in tax revenues for 2014, 16.16 percent higher than its 2013 collection goal of P1.25 trillion. The collection target is based on the 2014 medium term revenue program as of December 18 (2013), the BIR said. Income taxes still accounted for the bulk of the BIR's revenue goal at P855.77 billion or about 58.6 percent of total. About P325.74 billion will be sourced from value-added tax, 21.27 percent more than 2013's goal of P268.6 billion. The excise tax collection goal for 2014 is P124.17 billion, 8.5 percent of the aggregate target. The BIR is seen to have increased its tax effort to 10.5 percent or a little over its target of 10.6 percent as a result of the sin tax reform law, which imposed higher taxes on tobacco and alcoholic beverages beginning January 2013. The agency's intensified campaign against tax evaders was likewise attributed to BIR's higher tax revenues. Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima that the BIR still has room for growth in terms of collecting taxes given the billions of pesos in foregone revenues due to tax evasion. An estimate by various groups puts Philippines' losses from tax evasion at P380 billion to P450 billion a year. Non-payment of taxes and under declaration of incomes among self-employed professionals and individuals remain a problem by the government. The government's role is to shore up tax effort to a record 16 percent before the end of President Aquino's term in 2016. Tax effort measures the government's efficiency in collecting taxes and is computed by dividing collections into the country's total economic output. BIR misses target for January The Bureau of Internal Revenue's collection rose nearly 10 percent in January 2014, but fell short of its target for the month. The BIR said it collected P104.15 billion in January 2014, 8.32 percent below the P113.6-billion target as tax evasion remains rampant, with the country losing P380 billion to P450 billion a year. Of the total, collections from BIR operations grew 11.9 percent to P99.61 billion while non-BIR operations accounted for P4.54 billion or 20.13 percent less than the collections made in the same month in 2013. Collections by the regional offices reached P39.03 billion, 16.64 percent higher than the previous year's level. The large taxpayers' service, on the other hand, collected P60.59 billion, up 9.02 percent year on year. The BIR aims to collect P1.47 trillion for 2014, 16.8 percent more than the previous year's P1.25 trillion as it steps up its audit and enforcement capabilities. It has filed more than 200 tax evasion cases since the start of President Aquino's term. Majority of these cases, however, are still pending with the Department of Justice. The BIR is also banking on its shame campaign targeting unscrupulous tax evaders. Under this program, the BIR in tandem with the Department of Finance publishes on weekly basis tax payments of entities belonging to certain sectors. With the weekly tax watch advertisements, the BIR is hopeful that the number of taxpayers will increase. To ensure double-digit pace of its collections, the BIR is also zeroing in on value-added tax leakages given the government's meager VAT collections. Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said VAT collections are way too small compared with the growing consumption of Filipinos. VAT is a tax on consumption and carries a rate of 12 percent on the prices of goods and services. Customs misses monthly revenue target again For the second month in a row, the Bureau of Customs failed to meet its revenue goal with a collection of a little over P26 billion, some P4 billion short of its February 2014 target of P30.18 billion. The Manila truck ban was cited as one of the reasons for the lower collection, aside from the seasonal slump in imports. Still, the revenue for the four-week trading period was P3.71 billion higher than the P22.47 billion collected in the same period in 2013, a \"preliminary revenue collection report\" shown to the Inquirer indicated. The report said that among the bureau's 17 collection districts nationwide, the Manila International Container Port suffered the biggest shortfall of P1.84 billion, followed by the Port of Manila with a deficit of P1.64 billion. In February 2014, the bureau acknowledged that both the POM and MICP, two of the country's biggest ports, were adversely affected by the truck ban imposed by Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada. It reported that from February 24 to 26 alone, the two ports registered revenue losses of P272.59 million and P217.39 million, respectively, or a total of P489.96 million. In a statement, the agency explained that the drop in the number of container vans of imported goods released from the POM and MICP resulted in a \"dramatic decline in the ports' revenue collections.\" Before the truck ban, the POM and MICP had daily average collections of P252.95 million and P359.76 million, respectively. Other ports that recorded collection deficits in February 2014 were Limay in Bataan, P830 million; Clark International Airport in Pampanga, P71.5 million; Iloilo City, P41.9 million; Legazpi City, P10.7 million; Zamboanga City, P3.5 million, among others. In January 2014, the bureau also failed to meet its revenue target of P31.3 billion with total collections of P29.78 billion, for a shortfall of P1.52 billion. However, the revenues for the 21-day trading period were P5.24 billion higher than P24.54 billion the agency collected in the same period in 2013. Eight of the 17 collection districts, including the MICP, POM, Naia, Aparri in Cagayan, and Tacloban City missed their revenue goals for the period. On the other hand, those that registered revenue surpluses included the ports of Batangas, Subic Freeport in Zambales, Davao, Cebu and Cagayan de Oro, among others. Customs take surged by 22% to P274B in February Customs collections surged by more than a fifth for the second straight month in February 2014, reinforcing expectations that reforms implemented by the Bureau's new leadership have started to gain traction. The growth in collections came despite a slight dip in the volume of imports for the month--a result of the ongoing truck ban in Manila where the country's major international ports are located. \"The sustained growth of our collections is strong evidence that we are moving in the right direction. But our job is far from over, and we remain focused on structural reforms which will deliver even stronger growth, more efficient processing and transparency in the future,\" Bureau of Customs (BOC) Commissioner John P. Sevilla said in a statement. Total collections of the Bureau of Customs reached P274 billion in February 2014, an increase of 22 percent year-on-year. This followed January 2014's 21-percent rise in collections. Year-to-date, collections totaled P57.2 billion. The amount is still 7 percent below the target set. Revenues continued to grow despite the 1.42-percent dip in the volume of imported goods in February 2014, compared with that of the same month in 2013. Recently, truckers groups initiated a work stoppage to protest the expanded truck ban in Manila. Collections in nine of the 14 ports under the BOC's supervision fell short of the target set. The Port of Manila and Manila International Container Terminal (MICT) both missed their collection targets. At the Port of Manila, collections reached P4.806 billion against the target of P6.440 billion. Collections at MICT stood at P6.892 billion--lower than the P8.728-billion target. Batangas, the country's second largest port, exceeded its collections target by 10.83 percent to reach P6.238 billion. The BOC continued to outperform its larger sister agency, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, which saw tax collections rise by 5.18 percent in the same month. World Bank urges gov't to raise taxes; Huge infra spending to keep growth high Raising government revenues further to finance the state's ambitious infrastructure program will be key to keeping economic growth above the 7-percent threshold for increasing jobs and reducing poverty, the World Bank said. In its East Asia and Pacific Economic Update report released on April 7, the multilateral lender said lawmakers should seriously consider raising existing taxes--similar to what was done for excise taxes in 2012--as a quick way of growing state coffers. The government was also told to sustain reforms in tax administration to improve collections and broaden the state's revenue base. \"Clearly, there is tremendous need in the Philippines [for resources] in several areas ... most prominently for infrastructure, and that's going to cost money,\" World Bank East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist Bert Hoffman said at a press briefing. \"To remain sustainable at a fiscal deficit level, revenues have to be raised further and it can't be done just with administrative measures. It doesn't have to be new taxes, but simply updates to existing taxes.\" In its report, the World Bank said the Philippine economy's growth was expected to slow down by six-tenths of a percentage point to 6.6 percent for 2014 as damage to key provinces caused by Supertyphoon \"Yolanda\" late in 2013 adversely affect business activity and consumer demand. This would be slower than the 2013's 7.2 percent. The bank's projection was the same as its previous forecast, which was published in March 2014. The updated forecast was still within the government's growth target of 6.5 to 7.5 percent for 2014. Additional spending on infrastructure, made possible through higher revenues, would be crucial for the country to meet the government's target of growth of up to 8.5 percent in 2016, the World Bank said. The Aquino administration wants to raise infrastructure spending to the equivalent of 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2016, up from just 2.5 percent in 2013. World Bank senior economist for the Philippines Karl Kendrick Chua said that apart from raising the rate for existing taxes, improving collections through stricter enforcement held more promise for increasing revenues. He cited the example of the expanded value-added tax (E-VAT), which was raised to 12 percent from 10 percent in 2006. Prior to the increase, collection efficiency averaged 30 percent. After raising the rate, efficiency increased to 35 percent, but in the five years that followed, was eroded back to 30 percent. \"What this tells us is that the problem is the administration,\" Chua said. Chua noted that in 1997, tax collections in the country were equivalent to 18 percent of GDP. This fell to 12 percent in 2010. He said the Aquino administration has been successful in slowly raising taxes relative to GDP. In 2012 alone, tax collections rose by 0.6 percent of GDP. Budget deficit narrowed in February; Two-month shortfall still 40% higher at P43.9B The shortfall between the state's revenues and expenses narrowed in February as reforms at the Bureau of Customs reaped dividends in the form of higher collections. Documents released by the Bureau of the Treasury on April 14 showed the budget deficit in February 2014 eased to P9.7 billion, down 17 percent year-on-year. This brought the year-to-date deficit to P43.9 billion, up 40 percent from the same two-month period in 2013. \"The President's Customs Reform Program continues to unlock the growth potential of the Bureau of Customs and is a continuing narrative of how good governance translates into good economics,\" Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said. Customs collections were up by more than a fifth in February 2014, the second consecutive month that revenue growth topped 20 percent. Collections by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) rose 8 percent to P182.5 billion in the two-month period from a year ago (2013), but continued to be off target. The Customs bureau, meanwhile, grew revenues by 22 percent to P57.2 billion. The growth in revenues outpaced spending for the two months, official documents showed. Combined expenditures for the two months totaled P313 billion, which is an 11-percent increase over figures in the same period in 2013. Interest payments for February 2014 amounted to P15.9 billion, 11 percent up year-on-year. The lower deficit also came as a result of the success of the government's liability management program. Interest payments in February 2014 decreased by 11 percent compared to the same period in 2013. Netting out interest payments, the national government recorded a primary surplus for February 2014 of P6.1 billion, bringing the year-to-date surplus to P28.4 billion. In the first quarter of 2014, the DOF's anti-graft arm, the Revenue Integrity Protection Service, was able to secure eight suspensions and dismissals of BIR and BOC personnel found to be living beyond their means. The Aquino administration also remains committed to completing systemic reforms in its revenue-generating agencies through transparency and accountability measures, the DOF said. Aside from the monthly public disclosure of all import transactions by the Bureau of Customs, the DOF also made local government unit (LGU) fiscal sustainability scorecards available for public viewing through the Iskor ng 'yong Bayan (iskor.blgf.gov.ph), an initiative to make local treasurers and assessors accountable to the public for their local fiscal management. The DOF likewise continues to push for the following bills that would improve the country's fiscal sustainability: The tax incentives management transparency and accountability (TIMTA) act, the rationalization of fiscal incentives, the reform of the fiscal regime for mining and the customs modernization and tariff act (CMTA). BIR continues to miss collection target; Year-on-year, revenues in March rose 9.82% to P82.18B Collections of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in March 2014 rose by nearly a tenth from that of 2013 but still fell short of the government's goal despite aggressive campaigns against tax evaders. Government documents released on April 15 showed that BIR collections rose by 9.82 percent to P82.18 billion in March 2014 from the same period in 2013. However, this was lower than the target of P90.5 billion for the month. The year-on-year growth in collections in March 2014 was better than the 5.18-percent increase recorded in February 2014. Data released earlier showed the country's budget shortfall in the first two months of 2014 rose 40 percent to P43.9 billion as the government increased spending for reconstruction efforts in Visayas. April 2014's collection target has been set at P176.51 billion, higher than last April's collection goal of P142.7 billion. Collections in April 2014 are expected to be the highest for any month in 2014 because of the April 15 deadline for many tax payments. In a bid to boost collections, the government launched several public information campaigns to encourage small businesses and self-employed individuals to declare their proper income and pay the corresponding taxes. Among these were the Department of Finance's \"Tax Watch\" shame campaign launched last July 2013. This involves the weekly publication of lists of individual and corporate taxpayers in various industries. Tax Watch's goal is to show the public who among self-employed individuals and companies pay taxes disproportionately smaller than the size of their wealth. For March 2014, collections from BIR operations amounted to P78.91 billion, P6.95 billion or 9.66-percent more than collections made in March 2013. Collections from non-BIR operations amounted to P3.27 billion, P400.85 million or 13.98-percent up year-on-year. The BIR said collections of regional offices totaled P31.79 billion, or P2.9 billion or 10.03 percent more than the collections made in March 2013, continuing with the previous year's trend of double-digit growth registered by the regional offices. Collections of the Large Taxpayer Service (LTS) amounted to P47.12 billion, P4.05 billion or 9.41-percent more than collections made in March 2013. BIR misses April collection target; Vows 'intensified' audit of corporate books The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has announced plans for more detailed audits of taxpayers suspected of hiding profits from the government as part of efforts to boost collections. BIR collections for April 2014, the year's tax season, grew at a muted pace despite aggressive government campaigns to get firms and professionals to pay more. \"The BIR still believes that it will be able to recover during the remaining months of 2014,\" the state's main money-maker said in a statement. Collections for April 2014 stood at P156.1 billion, 4.78-percent higher year-on-year. However, this was the slowest growth for any month so far for 2014. The BIR's revenue was also short of the goal of P176.51 billion for the month. Alarmed by the muted expansion in collections, the BIR said it would start an \"intensified\" audit of books of taxpayers that paid less for the fiscal year 2013 despite posting higher revenues for the same period. Collections were pulled down by the lower payments of large and corporate taxpayers in the National Capital Region. Although the gross revenues of these taxpayers increased, these did not translate to tax revenues as they enjoyed some forms of tax incentives, the BIR said. The BIR called on lawmakers to speed up the passage of the Fiscal Incentive Rationalization Bill, which was earlier certified as urgent by MalacaÃ±ang. The proposed measure aims to reduce excessive tax perks that companies are entitled to under existing laws. Internal Revenue Commissioner Kim Henares said a study for the year 2011, covering 39 percent of companies that received tax perks that year, showed that the government lost P65 billion annually in income taxes due to these perks. She said this trend likely continued for the fiscal year 2013. \"Although they had growth in revenue, this didn't translate into taxes. It's important for us to look at these incentives,\" she told the Inquirer. The agency said this measure would be \"imperative\" to raising state revenues, which are needed to bankroll the Aquino administration's expensive infrastructure program. She said consecutive calamities in the second half of last year--chief of them Typhoon \"Yolanda\"--might have also contributed to slow growth in revenues. By 2016, the government plans to spend 20 percent of its annual budget--the equivalent of 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)--on infrastructure projects to allow the country to catch up on its neighbors in the region./WDJ",

    "content_html": "<p><em>(Part of Philippine Economic Report for 2014)</em></p> <p><strong>What is government revenue?</strong></p> <p>Government revenues are primarily being referred to as â€“ taxes. The best examples of government revenue are taxes collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and the Customsâ€™ duties and taxes collected by the Bureau of Customs.</p> <p>Quite often, funds that were generated by government instrumentalities from payments of â€œpermit feesâ€ are likewise categorized as â€œrevenuesâ€. And so with the â€œsharesâ€ from income of government owned or controlled corporations, for instance â€“ Pagcor.</p> <p>It is also notable to mention here that the government also receives shares from the payment of â€œroyaltiesâ€, collected from the income and proceeds of Malampaya Gas Exploration and other similar big stake government projects.</p> <p>And lest we forget, the governmentâ€™s income from the â€œleasesâ€ of its properties.</p> <p>These revenues will provide the government the funds that are much needed in its operation to promote the general welfare and well-being of its citizenry.</p> <p>In my recent study about taxes and development, I had the opportunity to read the 12-page research paper, prepared by Keith Patterson of the Tax and Development Programme of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p> <p>Patterson said that tax revenues provide governments with the funds they need to invest in development, relieve poverty, deliver public services and build the physical and social infrastructure for long-term growth.</p> <p>However, the same OECD study has also observed that many developing countries face challenges in increasing their revenue from domestic sources. These challenges include a small tax base, a large informal sector, weak governance and administrative capacity, low levels of per capita income, domestic savings and investment and possibly tax avoidance by elites.</p> <p>Without much ado, let us talk about â€œgovernment revenues.â€</p> <p>In the process, we will have the opportunity to know firsthand what transpired in our governmentâ€™s effort to generate the revenues for the much needed development and in the building of physical and social infrastructure for long-term growth.</p> <p><strong>Govâ€™t tax effort improves to 13.4%</strong></p> <p>The Aquino administrationâ€™s tax effort is seen to have improved by half a basis point in 2013 to 13.4 percent, mainly due to robust collections by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Department of Finance (DOF) reported on January 7 (2014).</p> <p>Tax effort measures the governmentâ€™s efficiency in collecting taxes and is computed by dividing collections into the countryâ€™s total economic output.</p> <p>2013â€™s revenue effort was just .1 basis point shy of the governmentâ€™s goal of 13.5 percent.</p> <p>The BIR, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the governmentâ€™s total revenues, is seen to have increased its tax effort to 10.5 percent or a little over its target of 10.6 percent as a result of the sin tax reform law, which imposed higher taxes on tobacco and alcoholic beverages beginning January 2013.</p> <p>The agencyâ€™s intensified campaign against tax evaders was likewise attributed to BIRâ€™s higher tax revenues.</p> <p>Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima believes that the BIR still has room for growth in terms of collecting taxes given the billions of pesos in foregone revenues due to tax evasion.</p> <p>An estimate by various groups puts Philippinesâ€™ losses from tax evasion at P380 billion to P450 billion a year.</p> <p>Non-payment of taxes and under declaration of incomes among self-employed professionals and individuals remain a problem by the government.</p> <p>The Bureau of Customsâ€™ tax effort, on the other hand, was seen to have settled at 2.7 percent, roughly the same level as 2013. The agency, however, missed its 2013 tax collection goal of 2.9 percent.</p> <p>The governmentâ€™s role is to shore up tax effort to a record 16 percent before the end of President Aquinoâ€™s term in 2016.</p> <p>The BIR was tasked to collect P1.25 trillion in 2013, 17.6 percent higher than the previous yearâ€™s collection. In the 11 months to November 2013, the agency collected P1.12 trillion, already exceeding total collections for the whole of 2012.</p> <p><strong>BIR sets P1.46-T target for 2014</strong></p> <p>The Bureau of Internal Revenue is eyeing P1.46 trillion in tax revenues for 2014, 16.16 percent higher than its 2013 collection goal of P1.25 trillion.</p> <p>The collection target is based on the 2014 medium term revenue program as of December 18 (2013), the BIR said.</p> <p>Income taxes still accounted for the bulk of the BIRâ€™s revenue goal at P855.77 billion or about 58.6 percent of total.</p> <p>About P325.74 billion will be sourced from value-added tax, 21.27 percent more than 2013â€™s goal of P268.6 billion.</p> <p>The excise tax collection goal for 2014 is P124.17 billion, 8.5 percent of the aggregate target.</p> <p>The BIR is seen to have increased its tax effort to 10.5 percent or a little over its target of 10.6 percent as a result of the sin tax reform law, which imposed higher taxes on tobacco and alcoholic beverages beginning January 2013.</p> <p>The agencyâ€™s intensified campaign against tax evaders was likewise attributed to BIRâ€™s higher tax revenues.</p> <p>Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima that the BIR still has room for growth in terms of collecting taxes given the billions of pesos in foregone revenues due to tax evasion.</p> <p>An estimate by various groups puts Philippinesâ€™ losses from tax evasion at P380 billion to P450 billion a year.</p> <p>Non-payment of taxes and under declaration of incomes among self-employed professionals and individuals remain a problem by the government.</p> <p>The governmentâ€™s role is to shore up tax effort to a record 16 percent before the end of President Aquinoâ€™s term in 2016.</p> <p>Tax effort measures the governmentâ€™s efficiency in collecting taxes and is computed by dividing collections into the countryâ€™s total economic output.</p> <p><strong>BIR misses target for January</strong></p> <p>The Bureau of Internal Revenueâ€™s collection rose nearly 10 percent in January 2014, but fell short of its target for the month.</p> <p>The BIR said it collected P104.15 billion in January 2014, 8.32 percent below the P113.6-billion target as tax evasion remains rampant, with the country losing P380 billion to P450 billion a year.</p> <p>Of the total, collections from BIR operations grew 11.9 percent to P99.61 billion while non-BIR operations accounted for P4.54 billion or 20.13 percent less than the collections made in the same month in 2013.</p> <p>Collections by the regional offices reached P39.03 billion, 16.64 percent higher than the previous yearâ€™s level.</p> <p>The large taxpayersâ€™ service, on the other hand, collected P60.59 billion, up 9.02 percent year on year.</p> <p>The BIR aims to collect P1.47 trillion for 2014, 16.8 percent more than the previous yearâ€™s P1.25 trillion as it steps up its audit and enforcement capabilities.</p> <p>It has filed more than 200 tax evasion cases since the start of President Aquinoâ€™s term. Majority of these cases, however, are still pending with the Department of Justice.</p> <p>The BIR is also banking on its shame campaign targeting unscrupulous tax evaders. Under this program, the BIR in tandem with the Department of Finance publishes on weekly basis tax payments of entities belonging to certain sectors.</p> <p>With the weekly tax watch advertisements, the BIR is hopeful that the number of taxpayers will increase.</p> <p>To ensure double-digit pace of its collections, the BIR is also zeroing in on value-added tax leakages given the governmentâ€™s meager VAT collections.</p> <p>Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said VAT collections are way too small compared with the growing consumption of Filipinos.</p> <p>VAT is a tax on consumption and carries a rate of 12 percent on the prices of goods and services.</p> <p><strong>Customs misses monthly revenue target again</strong></p> <p>For the second month in a row, the Bureau of Customs failed to meet its revenue goal with a collection of a little over P26 billion, some P4 billion short of its February 2014 target of P30.18 billion.</p> <p>The Manila truck ban was cited as one of the reasons for the lower collection, aside from the seasonal slump in imports.</p> <p>Still, the revenue for the four-week trading period was P3.71 billion higher than the P22.47 billion collected in the same period in 2013, a â€œpreliminary revenue collection reportâ€ shown to the Inquirer indicated.</p> <p>The report said that among the bureauâ€™s 17 collection districts nationwide, the Manila International Container Port suffered the biggest shortfall of P1.84 billion, followed by the Port of Manila with a deficit of P1.64 billion.</p> <p>In February 2014, the bureau acknowledged that both the POM and MICP, two of the countryâ€™s biggest ports, were adversely affected by the truck ban imposed by Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada.</p> <p>It reported that from February 24 to 26 alone, the two ports registered revenue losses of P272.59 million and P217.39 million, respectively, or a total of P489.96 million.</p> <p>In a statement, the agency explained that the drop in the number of container vans of imported goods released from the POM and MICP resulted in a â€œdramatic decline in the portsâ€™ revenue collections.â€</p> <p>Before the truck ban, the POM and MICP had daily average collections of P252.95 million and P359.76 million, respectively.</p> <p>Other ports that recorded collection deficits in February 2014 were Limay in Bataan, P830 million; Clark International Airport in Pampanga, P71.5 million; Iloilo City, P41.9 million; Legazpi City, P10.7 million; Zamboanga City, P3.5 million, among others.</p> <p>In January 2014, the bureau also failed to meet its revenue target of P31.3 billion with total collections of P29.78 billion, for a shortfall of P1.52 billion.</p> <p>However, the revenues for the 21-day trading period were P5.24 billion higher than P24.54 billion the agency collected in the same period in 2013.</p> <p>Eight of the 17 collection districts, including the MICP, POM, Naia, Aparri in Cagayan, and Tacloban City missed their revenue goals for the period.</p> <p>On the other hand, those that registered revenue surpluses included the ports of Batangas, Subic Freeport in Zambales, Davao, Cebu and Cagayan de Oro, among others.</p> <p><strong>Customs take surged by 22% to P274B in February</strong></p> <p>Customs collections surged by more than a fifth for the second straight month in February 2014, reinforcing expectations that reforms implemented by the Bureauâ€™s new leadership have started to gain traction.</p> <p>The growth in collections came despite a slight dip in the volume of imports for the monthâ€”a result of the ongoing truck ban in Manila where the countryâ€™s major international ports are located.</p> <p>â€œThe sustained growth of our collections is strong evidence that we are moving in the right direction. But our job is far from over, and we remain focused on structural reforms which will deliver even stronger growth, more efficient processing and transparency in the future,â€ Bureau of Customs (BOC) Commissioner John P. Sevilla said in a statement.</p> <p>Total collections of the Bureau of Customs reached P274 billion in February 2014, an increase of 22 percent year-on-year. This followed January 2014â€™s 21-percent rise in collections.</p> <p>Year-to-date, collections totaled P57.2 billion. The amount is still 7 percent below the target set.</p> <p>Revenues continued to grow despite the 1.42-percent dip in the volume of imported goods in February 2014, compared with that of the same month in 2013.</p> <p>Recently, truckers groups initiated a work stoppage to protest the expanded truck ban in Manila.</p> <p>Collections in nine of the 14 ports under the BOCâ€™s supervision fell short of the target set. The Port of Manila and Manila International Container Terminal (MICT) both missed their collection targets. At the Port of Manila, collections reached P4.806 billion against the target of P6.440 billion. Collections at MICT stood at P6.892 billionâ€”lower than the P8.728-billion target.</p> <p>Batangas, the countryâ€™s second largest port, exceeded its collections target by 10.83 percent to reach P6.238 billion.</p> <p>The BOC continued to outperform its larger sister agency, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, which saw tax collections rise by 5.18 percent in the same month.</p> <p><strong>World Bank urges govâ€™t to raise taxes;</strong></p> <p><strong>Huge infra spending to keep growth high</strong></p> <p>Raising government revenues further to finance the stateâ€™s ambitious infrastructure program will be key to keeping economic growth above the 7-percent threshold for increasing jobs and reducing poverty, the World Bank said.</p> <p>In its East Asia and Pacific Economic Update report released on April 7, the multilateral lender said lawmakers should seriously consider raising existing taxesâ€”similar to what was done for excise taxes in 2012â€”as a quick way of growing state coffers.</p> <p>The government was also told to sustain reforms in tax administration to improve collections and broaden the stateâ€™s revenue base.</p> <p>â€œClearly, there is tremendous need in the Philippines [for resources] in several areas â€¦ most prominently for infrastructure, and thatâ€™s going to cost money,â€ World Bank East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist Bert Hoffman said at a press briefing. â€œTo remain sustainable at a fiscal deficit level, revenues have to be raised further and it canâ€™t be done just with administrative measures. It doesnâ€™t have to be new taxes, but simply updates to existing taxes.â€</p> <p>In its report, the World Bank said the Philippine economyâ€™s growth was expected to slow down by six-tenths of a percentage point to 6.6 percent for 2014 as damage to key provinces caused by Supertyphoon â€œYolandaâ€ late in 2013 adversely affect business activity and consumer demand.</p> <p>This would be slower than the 2013â€™s 7.2 percent. The bankâ€™s projection was the same as its previous forecast, which was published in March 2014. The updated forecast was still within the governmentâ€™s growth target of 6.5 to 7.5 percent for 2014.</p> <p>Additional spending on infrastructure, made possible through higher revenues, would be crucial for the country to meet the governmentâ€™s target of growth of up to 8.5 percent in 2016, the World Bank said.</p> <p>The Aquino administration wants to raise infrastructure spending to the equivalent of 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2016, up from just 2.5 percent in 2013.</p> <p>World Bank senior economist for the Philippines Karl Kendrick Chua said that apart from raising the rate for existing taxes, improving collections through stricter enforcement held more promise for increasing revenues.</p> <p>He cited the example of the expanded value-added tax (E-VAT), which was raised to 12 percent from 10 percent in 2006. Prior to the increase, collection efficiency averaged 30 percent. After raising the rate, efficiency increased to 35 percent, but in the five years that followed, was eroded back to 30 percent. â€œWhat this tells us is that the problem is the administration,â€ Chua said.</p> <p>Chua noted that in 1997, tax collections in the country were equivalent to 18 percent of GDP. This fell to 12 percent in 2010. He said the Aquino administration has been successful in slowly raising taxes relative to GDP. In 2012 alone, tax collections rose by 0.6 percent of GDP.</p> <p><strong>Budget deficit narrowed in February</strong>;</p> <p><strong>Two-month shortfall still 40% higher at P43.9B</strong></p> <p>The shortfall between the stateâ€™s revenues and expenses narrowed in February as reforms at the Bureau of Customs reaped dividends in the form of higher collections.</p> <p>Documents released by the Bureau of the Treasury on April 14 showed the budget deficit in February 2014 eased to P9.7 billion, down 17 percent year-on-year. This brought the year-to-date deficit to P43.9 billion, up 40 percent from the same two-month period in 2013.</p> <p>â€œThe Presidentâ€™s Customs Reform Program continues to unlock the growth potential of the Bureau of Customs and is a continuing narrative of how good governance translates into good economics,â€ Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said.</p> <p>Customs collections were up by more than a fifth in February 2014, the second consecutive month that revenue growth topped 20 percent.</p> <p>Collections by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) rose 8 percent to P182.5 billion in the two-month period from a year ago (2013), but continued to be off target. The Customs bureau, meanwhile, grew revenues by 22 percent to P57.2 billion.</p> <p>The growth in revenues outpaced spending for the two months, official documents showed.</p> <p>Combined expenditures for the two months totaled P313 billion, which is an 11-percent increase over figures in the same period in 2013. Interest payments for February 2014 amounted to P15.9 billion, 11 percent up year-on-year.</p> <p>The lower deficit also came as a result of the success of the governmentâ€™s liability management program. Interest payments in February 2014 decreased by 11 percent compared to the same period in 2013.</p> <p>Netting out interest payments, the national government recorded a primary surplus for February 2014 of P6.1 billion, bringing the year-to-date surplus to P28.4 billion.</p> <p>In the first quarter of 2014, the DOFâ€™s anti-graft arm, the Revenue Integrity Protection Service, was able to secure eight suspensions and dismissals of BIR and BOC personnel found to be living beyond their means.</p> <p>The Aquino administration also remains committed to completing systemic reforms in its revenue-generating agencies through transparency and accountability measures, the DOF said.</p> <p>Aside from the monthly public disclosure of all import transactions by the Bureau of Customs, the DOF also made local government unit (LGU) fiscal sustainability scorecards available for public viewing through the Iskor ng â€™yong Bayan (iskor.blgf.gov.ph), an initiative to make local treasurers and assessors accountable to the public for their local fiscal management.</p> <p>The DOF likewise continues to push for the following bills that would improve the countryâ€™s fiscal sustainability: The tax incentives management transparency and accountability (TIMTA) act, the rationalization of fiscal incentives, the reform of the fiscal regime for mining and the customs modernization and tariff act (CMTA).</p> <p><strong>BIR continues to miss collection target;</strong></p> <p><strong>Year-on-year, revenues in March rose 9.82% to P82.18B</strong></p> <p>Collections of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in March 2014 rose by nearly a tenth from that of 2013 but still fell short of the governmentâ€™s goal despite aggressive campaigns against tax evaders.</p> <p>Government documents released on April 15 showed that BIR collections rose by 9.82 percent to P82.18 billion in March 2014 from the same period in 2013. However, this was lower than the target of P90.5 billion for the month.</p> <p>The year-on-year growth in collections in March 2014 was better than the 5.18-percent increase recorded in February 2014.</p> <p>Data released earlier showed the countryâ€™s budget shortfall in the first two months of 2014 rose 40 percent to P43.9 billion as the government increased spending for reconstruction efforts in Visayas.</p> <p>April 2014â€™s collection target has been set at P176.51 billion, higher than last Aprilâ€™s collection goal of P142.7 billion. Collections in April 2014 are expected to be the highest for any month in 2014 because of the April 15 deadline for many tax payments.</p> <p>In a bid to boost collections, the government launched several public information campaigns to encourage small businesses and self-employed individuals to declare their proper income and pay the corresponding taxes.</p> <p>Among these were the Department of Financeâ€™s â€œTax Watchâ€ shame campaign launched last July 2013. This involves the weekly publication of lists of individual and corporate taxpayers in various industries.</p> <p>Tax Watchâ€™s goal is to show the public who among self-employed individuals and companies pay taxes disproportionately smaller than the size of their wealth.</p> <p>For March 2014, collections from BIR operations amounted to P78.91 billion, P6.95 billion or 9.66-percent more than collections made in March 2013. Collections from non-BIR operations amounted to P3.27 billion, P400.85 million or 13.98-percent up year-on-year.</p> <p>The BIR said collections of regional offices totaled P31.79 billion, or P2.9 billion or 10.03 percent more than the collections made in March 2013, continuing with the previous yearâ€™s trend of double-digit growth registered by the regional offices.</p> <p>Collections of the Large Taxpayer Service (LTS) amounted to P47.12 billion, P4.05 billion or 9.41-percent more than collections made in March 2013.</p> <p><strong>BIR misses April collection target;</strong></p> <p><strong>Vows â€˜intensifiedâ€™ audit of corporate books</strong></p> <p>The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) has announced plans for more detailed audits of taxpayers suspected of hiding profits from the government as part of efforts to boost collections.</p> <p>BIR collections for April 2014, the yearâ€™s tax season, grew at a muted pace despite aggressive government campaigns to get firms and professionals to pay more.</p> <p>â€œThe BIR still believes that it will be able to recover during the remaining months of 2014,â€ the stateâ€™s main money-maker said in a statement.</p> <p>Collections for April 2014 stood at P156.1 billion, 4.78-percent higher year-on-year. However, this was the slowest growth for any month so far for 2014. The BIRâ€™s revenue was also short of the goal of P176.51 billion for the month.</p> <p>Alarmed by the muted expansion in collections, the BIR said it would start an â€œintensifiedâ€ audit of books of taxpayers that paid less for the fiscal year 2013 despite posting higher revenues for the same period.</p> <p>Collections were pulled down by the lower payments of large and corporate taxpayers in the National Capital Region. Although the gross revenues of these taxpayers increased, these did not translate to tax revenues as they enjoyed some forms of tax incentives, the BIR said.</p> <p>The BIR called on lawmakers to speed up the passage of the Fiscal Incentive Rationalization Bill, which was earlier certified as urgent by MalacaÃ±ang. The proposed measure aims to reduce excessive tax perks that companies are entitled to under existing laws.</p> <p>Internal Revenue Commissioner Kim Henares said a study for the year 2011, covering 39 percent of companies that received tax perks that year, showed that the government lost P65 billion annually in income taxes due to these perks.</p> <p>She said this trend likely continued for the fiscal year 2013. â€œAlthough they had growth in revenue, this didnâ€™t translate into taxes. Itâ€™s important for us to look at these incentives,â€ she told the Inquirer.</p> <p>The agency said this measure would be â€œimperativeâ€ to raising state revenues, which are needed to bankroll the Aquino administrationâ€™s expensive infrastructure program.</p> <p>She said consecutive calamities in the second half of last yearâ€”chief of them Typhoon â€œYolandaâ€â€”might have also contributed to slow growth in revenues.</p> <p>By 2016, the government plans to spend 20 percent of its annual budgetâ€”the equivalent of 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)â€”on infrastructure projects to allow the country to catch up on its neighbors in the region./<strong>WDJ</strong></p>"

Out of hundreds of applicants, only 50 made it to the final list.Recipients were chosen based on the family income and upon the recommendation of the Local Government Units where they reside.

    "text": "THE Supreme Court (SC) ordered the government Tuesday to defend the legality of recent joint military exercises with Japan following a petition by a left-wing political party. The Alliance of Concern Teachers party's petition questions the constitutionality of the exercises, which were held without a treaty being approved by the Senate. SC spokesman Theodore Te said the magistrates ordered President Benigno Aquino III's office, Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and other officials to comment on the petition and explain why the exercises were constitutional. The party has asked the court to prohibit such exercises by issuing a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction. It also urged the court to strike down as unconstitutional a memorandum of defense cooperation signed by Philippine and Japanese officials in Tokyo in January, as well as a strategic partnership agreement signed by Aquino and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during Aquino's visit to Tokyo last month. A Japanese surveillance plane and about 20 troops held two days of joint training with the Philippine navy last month off the coast of western Palawan, a strategically important island not far from contested islands claimed by several countries, including China and the Philippines.

    "text": "Iligan City, Lanao del Norte, July 27 - The Department of Labor and Employment-Region 10 (DOLE-10), through its Lanao del Norte (LDN) Provincial Field Office (PFO) held a Government Internship Program (GIP) orientation on 15 July 2015 to its seven trainees of the Lone District of Lanao del Norte at the DOLE-10 LDNPFO, second floor of the B &B Building, Mahayahay Highway, Iligan City.DOLE-10 Regional Director Raymundo G. Agravante underscores the GIP of the Department that provides an internship opportunity for college graduates/ undergraduates especially those who want to pursue a career in the government or in the field of labor and employment.Eligible applicants are college graduates or must have completed at least two years of college studies or its equivalent. Furthermore, applicants must not have been formally employed or availed the same program with other government agencies. They should also be between the ages of 18-25 years old and hold degrees in discipline or those considered relevant to the Department's functions like economics, law, labor and industrial relations, political science, the social sciences and journalism, management, accounting, public administration and psychology.Topics discussed were Labor Market Information and Employment Coaching.The oriented trainees were then assigned to the different government offices within Iligan City.Director Agravante motivated the trainees, \"We hope that DOLE has given you, fresh graduates, opportunities to pursue careers in the government. Your three months' work in your respective offices may have equipped you with the necessary skills, knowledge, and abilities in the world of work. It is our optimism that we, in the Department have served our purpose as your work role models.\"DOLE-10 LDN PFO Head, Remegio CabaÃ±og further encouraged, \"We believe that you are the future of our nation, and I hope some of you would become future public servants that have strong integrity.\"One of the trainees, Nancy DemontaÃ±o said, \"The GIP of the DOLE is a big help to us, especially in equipping us with work experiences for future job application and promotion. And icing on the cake is we also get to enjoy and receive an allowance equivalent to 75% of the prevailing minimum wage in the region.\" (Joseph Nathan Fabrega/DOLE-10 Lanao del Norte PFO)",

Furthermore, applicants must not have been formally employed or availed the same program with other government agencies. They should also be between the ages of 18-25 years old and hold degrees in discipline or those considered relevant to the Departmentâ€™s functions like economics, law, labor and industrial relations, political science, the social sciences and journalism, management, accounting, public administration and psychology.</p><p>Topics discussed were Labor Market Information and Employment Coaching.</p><p>The oriented trainees were then assigned to the different government offices within Iligan City.</p><p>Director Agravante motivated the trainees, â€œWe hope that DOLE has given you, fresh graduates, opportunities to pursue careers in the government. Your three monthsâ€™ work in your respective offices may have equipped you with the necessary skills, knowledge, and abilities in the world of work. It is our optimism that we, in the Department have served our purpose as your work role models.â€</p><p>DOLE-10 LDN PFO Head, Remegio CabaÃ±og further encouraged, â€œWe believe that you are the future of our nation, and I hope some of you would become future public servants that have strong integrity.â€</p><p>One of the trainees, Nancy DemontaÃ±o said, â€œThe GIP of the DOLE is a big help to us, especially in equipping us with work experiences for future job application and promotion.

    "text": "More than 100 best minds of the land attended the other day, at Club Filipino Greenhills, a summit for change to secure the country's future.  It was convened by the group of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Reynato Pino, former Ramos Budget Secretary Salvador Enriquez Jr., former Vice President Teofisto Guingona Jr., former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr., and former UP President Jose V. Abueva who now runs his own Kalayaan College. Aside from them as speakers, prominent economist Toti Chikiamco, former Comelec Commissioner Rene Sarmiento, Manila Bishop Broderick Pabillo, former Finance Undersecretary Nene Guevara, and Supreme Court Justice Francis Jardeleza shared their thoughts on assigned topics. The idea was to reform government and change its structure, from the present presidential to a parliamentary federal, by amending the Constitution. Quite expectedly, the present system came under stinging criticism. The presidential system concentrates power in Manila, in the president who is actually a dictator. Notice how easy it was for President BS Aquino III to oust a sitting chief justice through a mock trial conducted by the Senate, 22 of whose members were bribed by the chief executive to convict Renato Corona. Notice also how Congress and the Senate are in the stranglehold of Aquino, thanks to billions of taxpayers' money that he gives their members like he were Santa Claus.  No wonder, a Transparency International corruption survey in 2013 found that our politicians are the most corrupt Filipinos, after the police. In his keynote address, former Chief Justice Puno bristled with sarcasm. Amending the Constitution is not a head turner, he noticed, unlike issues like \"the expensive gowns that will be worn by the female members of Congress at the coming State of the Nation Address of the President; the latest hair color of Vice Ganda; the victims of macapuno candy poisoning; the Mutya ng Pilipinas beauty pageant, the ostentatious anniversary party of the Light Rail Transit Authority. And of course, the burning issue, which will continue to fire us until next year, is the coming presidential elections.\"  \"From bedroom to boardroom, the discussions swirl on whether Vice President Binay will get impeached or imprisoned before election; whether Secretary Mar Roxas will be finally anointed by President Aquino; whether Senators Grace Poe-Chiz Escudero will run as independent candidates; whether Senator Bongbong Marcos will bring back the Marcos presidency; whether Congressman Manny Pacquiao can knock out his opponents in the senatorial elections, etc.,\" Puno related.  The summit, the chief said, \"is a lamentation of our deficit of attention to the most serious social, economic and political problems of our country, problems that have accumulated for more than 100 years, problems that if further swept under the rug can tear to shreds the fragile fabric of our democratic society.\" He enumerated \"these stubborn problems\" - \"the deep roots of corruption in government; the viral spread of political dynasties in elective and appointive positions in government; the stranglehold of the economic elite on the wealth of the nation; the immoral multiplication of the poor in a nation wallowing in rich natural resources; the iniquitous electoral system that cannot prevent the triumph of the unqualified and perpetuates the victory of he who has the gold, and he who has the goons; government's inexcusable failure to address the legitimate demands of our ethnic and cultural minorities especially the demand for better rule by our Muslim brothers and sisters and our various indigenous people; government's continuing inability to negotiate peace with the NPA which now holds the world record of running the longest war against terrorism especially in the South where terrorists can kidnap and kill with apparent impunity.\"  In sum, the problems are: \"the impenitent impotence of government to fulfill its sacred covenant with the people to bring them a peace that endures, a prosperity with respect, and a progress with dignity.\" The summit thus sought to call attention to the problems and the solution, which is, in Puno's words, \"a system change in our Constitution, a paradigm shift from a presidential-unitary form of government to a parliamentary-federal form of government to a parliamentary-federal form of government.\" The former jurist, a Mason and a pastor, warned that our \"problems can bring down our house of democracy if they are dismissed with a shrug of shoulders. It is downtime for motherhood statements. It is uptime to save the motherland.\" The federal government, Puno argued, \"can best handle diversities driven by differences in culture, religion, language and geography because of its high threshold of tolerance to minorities.\" In the graveyard of democracies, he pointed out, \"you will find interred unitary states more than federal states.\" For his part, Nene Pimentel proposed dividing the country into 11 federal states - four in Luzon (Northern Luzon based in Tuguegarao, Central based in Tarlac City, Southern based in Tagaytay, and Bicol); four in the Visayas (Eastern, in Catbalogan; Central, in Toledo; Western Visayas, in Iloilo City; and either Negros or Minparom - Mindoro, Palawan, Romblom. Mindanao will be divided into three or four states - Northwestern Mindanao, Northeastern Mindanao, Southern Mindanao, and Bangsamoro. This one, Bangsamoro State, will solve secessionist rebellion, Pimentel contends. And it includes Sabah. Pimentel will retain the President, with a Prime Minister as head of government. He will retain the Senate, with 81 members, from 24 today, and the House whose congressmen will continue to be elected by district. In addition, the federal states will have their own legislatures. He also wants to redistribute the national budget 80 percent of which should go to LGUs, and only 20 percent to be spent by Manila. Will Congress allow a federal parliamentary system to replace a presidential system and a Congress dominated by dynasties? Academic Dr. Pepe Abueva gave his own answer - 75 percent of Congress members belong to political dynasties. Still, insisted Puno, the country must solve what he calls \"the immoral gap between the rich and the poor\". \"It's time to reverse the mindset of our masses that the best way to live in the Philippines is to leave it. It's time to show them that their most valuable property is not their passport.\" biznewsasia@gmail.com",

    "text": "A group of former government and Cabinet officials urged President Aquino yesterday to shift to a federal form of government as the present Constitution has failed to adjust to the nation's changing needs.  Former chief justice Reynato Puno, lead convenor of the Bagong Sistema, Bagong Pag-asa (BSBP), pointed out that \"our present form of government caused the majority to be deaf and dumb to the distinct needs of the minority, and gave them arrogance to impose uniformity despite the pluralism of the people.\"  \"Our experience under a unitary-presidential form of government runs for 80 years now. The question is, what has this unitary-presidential form of government brought to our people?\" Puno said.  The group claimed that the unitary form of government has failed the country \"for the longest time,\" as Puno cited the imbalance of powers not only among the three branches of government but also between the national government and the local government units and autonomous regions.  \"We have a government where power is tilted too much in favor of the executive,\" Puno said. \"Arguably, the biggest abuse of power in our tripartite government has been committed in our executive department.\"  \"Our democracy has collapsed under one president. We have a very strong president who has too much power,\" he added.  The former chief justice made his pitch for federalism during a BSBP summit dubbed as \"Securing the Country's Future\" at Club Filipino in Greenhills yesterday.  Aside from Puno, former Vice President Teofisto Guingona Jr., former Senate president Aquilino Pimentel Jr., Supreme Court Associate Justice Francis Jardeleza, former budget secretary Salvador Enriquez Jr., former 1986 Constitutional Commission member Rene Sarmiento, former University of the Philippines president Jose Abueva, Manila Auxiliary Bishop Broderick Pabillo and economist and author Calixto Chikiamco also aired their views.  They claimed that federalism is \"the best hope for our distinct minorities to be allowed self-rule\" - referring to Muslims in Mindanao.",

    "text": "LOS BAÃ‘OS, Laguna, Philippines - More projects under a program to enhance the ecology of Mt. Makiling have been launched through a government-private initiative. The Individual Tangible Response to Ecology Management (iTREE) is a by-product of the Habitat care program and efforts on tree planting and nurturing of the Makiling Center for Management Ecosystems. MCME is a center of the University of the Philippines Los BaÃ±os-College of Forestry and Natural Resources (UPLB-CFNR). The tree planting and nurturing program is a forest rehabilitation and restoration initiative of MCME in partnership with corporate entities. iTREE extends the program to take advantage of information and communication technology, including geographic information system, social media, and mapping technologies to allow for online viewing of planted trees. iTREE's rallying cry is \"I plant a tree today for the future.\" For years now, the UPLB-MCME has been partnering with companies to adopt a portion of Mt. Makiling for tree planting and nurturing. To date, much of the mountain has been reforested. \"We are going to expand our tree planting and nurturing by putting the plant and the planter on the map and see them through the iTREE project,\" MCME said. \"iTREE encourages Filipinos to visit iTREE planting areas and plant trees for the world to see.\"  Homepage ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1   Each tree planted is geo-referenced and attributed information - including the tree's common and scientific names, name of the person who planted the tree, date planted, and basic metrics such as height and diameter - are recorded. Location and attribute information will be uploaded to Mt. Makiling's website www.mountmakiling.org. \"Each tree planted will be cared for through donations and contributions from tree planters and our corporate partners,\" MCME said. Last June 25, for instance, AIR21, during the celebration of its 36th anniversary, planted 2,100 seedlings of banaba, alibangbang and Palawan cherry along the borders of Mt. Makiling in Puting Lupa, Calamba City. Many from AIR21 and its business partners, other business entities, MCME personnel members, and residents of Puting Lupa participated in the tree planting and nurturing activities. Among those present were AIR21 chairman and president Jerry Agnes, MCME director Nathaniel Bantayan, officials of the Lina group of companies, and community folk of Puting Lupa.",

    "text": "SEPANG: Former Sarawak Tribune editor Lester Melanyi claimed today that the Sarawak Report news portal founder Clare Rewcastle-Brown and the opposition have been hatching a plot to discredit the government since a few years ago.  He said he would be naming more opposition politicians involved in videos to be released soon.  In an interview with Bernama here, Melanyi claimed that Rewcastle-Brown told him of the smear plan after her meeting with several opposition politicians in Singapore in 2012.  \"I was always informed by Clare (on things they discussed). Generally, they will discuss on how to discredit the government and tamper documents.  \"The plan was not hatched yesterday. It was well planned for many years. Since early 2012, or earlier,\" he said, adding that 1Malaysia Development Berhad was just one of the issues they were targeting.   Melanyi had appeared in an expose video released on YouTube linking Rewcastle-Brown and several opposition politicians who he said were falsifying documents connected to 1MDB.  He said the coming videos would be more \"explosive\" and more personalities involved in the plot would be named.  \"They will be more explosive. Doubts will be cleared,\" he said.  The videos are actually one video broken into several parts.  Part one was released on July 15, and the second on Monday.  The third part is expected to be released this weekend, Melanyi said.  Asked why he was disclosing the plot only now, Melanyi said he did not have sufficient information in 2012.  Yesterday, Bernama reported that police officers from Bukit Aman had recorded Melanyi's statement on the contents of the video on July 17 and 18 in Kuching.  Melanyi said he told the police the same thing that he said in the video. - BERNAMA",

    "text": "In May 2015, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) released information on the Philippines' economic performance for the first quarter of the year. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 5.2 percent was viewed by many analysts, government decision-makers and the market as lower than their expectations. For all quarters of 2012-2014, GDP growth was 5.5 percent or over. The slowing down of GDP growth started last year with growth targets being missed, reportedly on account of weak government spending, especially after the government suffered setbacks on the legal front, with the Supreme Court deciding to rule against the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) in the end of 2013 as well as the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) a semester later. The PDAF, initiated in 1990 as the Countrywide Development Fund (CDF), allowed legislators to recommend funding of small-scale infrastructure or community projects which fell outside the scope of the regular national infrastructure program, which was often restricted to large infrastructure items. In the past, the Supreme Court upheld the system's constitutionality, but the PDAF subsequently made the identification of a lawmaker's project \"mandatory\" rather than \"recommendatory.\" There was heightened interest for its abolition with an alleged misuse of at least P6 billion worth of lawmakers' discretionary funds sparked massive protests to abolish the system. The DAP, on the other hand, was initiated in October 2011 by the current government to transfer savings and unused funds from \"slow-disbursing\" programs of one department to fast-moving projects of another. In this case, the Supreme Court declared portions of the DAP as unconstitutional, namely, the creation of savings prior to the end of the fiscal year and the withdrawal of these funds for implementing agencies; the cross-border transfers of the savings from one department to another; and the allotment of funds for projects, activities, and programs not outlined in the General Appropriations Act. The DAP, though different from PDAF, was meant to address government under-spending, but it got lumped in the public eye with the PDAF as an \"excess.\" An examination of data on public expenditures across quarters of 2010 up to the first quarter of 2015 (see Figure 1), would show seasonality in government expenditures.  Public spending tends to be highest every year during the second quarter. In addition, it is easy to observe a generally increasing trend across the years. Figure 1. Quarterly Public Expenditures : Q1 2010- Q1 2015 (in million pesos, at constant 2000 prices).  Source: Philippine Statistics Authority When the Aquino administration came into power in the second quarter of 2012, it made increased transparency and accountability, including tighter enforcement, its mantra. However, this led to a slowing down of the use of public funds, putting growth at negative levels in their first three quarters of leadership (with a peaked negative growth in the first quarter of 2011). The Aquino administration made adjustments in its ways of doing things and eventually managed to have growth in real government spending at positive rates in 14 out of 19 quarters. Post-DAP situation Over 10 percent year-on-year quarterly growth rates for government spending is observed in all quarters of 2012 (peaking in the first quarter of 2012), beyond doubt a result of the DAP. However, after the Supreme Court rulings on the PDAF and on the DAP, state spending clearly started to go down, decelerating to negative 2.8 percent growth in the last quarter of 2013. Public spending appears not to have picked up. While the drive against corruption, and the increased framework for transparency and accountability have undoubtedly helped the country win credit rating upgrades, and some greater foreign investments, there is concern that this zeal for good governance may have undermined efforts for improved government spending and economic performance. The solution to the problem of corruption especially in the past administration carried the seed of the next problem: the zeal for good governance complicated the work of government unnecessarily. Instead of addressing issues that are most pressing for Filipinos, government agencies have to keep defending themselves in the public arena. With more \"accountability\" expected (i.e. particularly punishments for mistakes made), those involved in releasing budgets are undeniably getting too timid to spend because of fears of the dreaded reports of the Commission on Audit (COA), and the repercussions of having disallowances when one retires. The late Professor Angeles Buenaventura, former Dean of the then Statistics Center at UP Diliman, once pointed out \"COA rules are meant to run after the 5 percent engaged in crime, but the 95 percent suffer, and the 5 percent still manage to get away.\" Figure 2. Growth of Public Expenditures : Q1 2010- Q1 2015 (in %)  Source: Philippine Statistics Authority Secretary Florencio \"Butch\" Abad of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) suggested that there are structural weaknesses in the bureaucracy \"which were getting in the way of efficient spending\" and accounting for 42 percent of unutilized funds in government. Of the 2014 budget, 13 percent (or around P303 billion) was unspent. Government agencies seem unable to fully absorb available funds that are within and beyond their control, especially in infrastructure and capital outlay. While the DBM and Congress have been very supportive of budgets proposed by government agencies (in both the budget preparation and budget legislation phases of the government budget cycle), there has been a lack of absorption capacity among the government agencies for utilizing these funds. While budget allotments have been prepared and released much earlier than previous governments, utilization of government budgets has been reportedly weak. Issues on infrastructure This, however, is actually not a new problem. The country's foremost public finance expert, Rosario \"Chat\" Manasan of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, has written about this even as far back as more than a decade ago in the context of  infrastructure. Manasan has also provided very detailed recommendations on improving bidding and procurement processes, management information systems, monitoring and evaluation systems for projects and programs, institutional strength (not only in the DBM, but in the government agencies themselves to improve internal control), to name a few. The current issue on infrastructure is the weak utilization of government funds for public construction. The growth drop started during the last quarter of 2013, with a -10.5% growth rate in public construction. The weak government spending for construction continues at present, with a -24.% drop in the first quarter of 2015 from a 17.5% growth rate last year (figure 3). Figure 3. Growth Rates of Public Construction : Q1 2012 - Q1 2015 (in %)  The decreasing budget utilization for public construction has direct repercussions on the infrastructure conditions of the country. If the government persists in spending little for construction, there is little hope for addressing the lack of mass transport system and public highways that make living and working in Metro Manila very challenging. Infrastructure planning and execution is jammed, just like the thousands of daily commuters and private vehicle owners in the Metro as they travel to school or work.  Moreover, implementation of projects, especially on infrastructure, are clearly being slowed down also by judicial action ( temporary restraining orders on government projects with the private sector under the Public-Private Partnership) as well as some internal control processes (on procurement especially) within government agencies. Beyond budget execution, government may however need to re-examine the preparation, legislation, and the accountability processes of the entire budget cycle. Should DBM be focusing only on its budgetary role, or can it improve its management mandate (given that many DBM staff are accountants by profession)? Figure 4. Processes of the Government's Budget Cycle in the Philippines : Budget Preparation, Budget Legislation, Budget Execution and Budget Accountability  One of the writers of this article has worked in government for more than one and a half decade. When he was hired in 1999 as a junior manager at a government agency that had a very small number of personnel (the then Statistical Research and Training Center), he lobbied for better budgets both within the agency and outside the agency. He lamented how an agency that was mandated to conduct statistical research and statistical training activities was being given very limited funds even for the regular purchase of knowledge materials and equipment to actually conduct research and training. At that time, he was informed about constraints on proposing improved budgetary outlays (so called \"budget ceilings\") due to weak government resources. Occasionally he had to join meetings on the agency budget proposal at DBM, and deliberations at Congress on the budget (which sometimes took until wee hours of the morning). He noticed though that these budget deliberations were typically not even about the actual budget proposals per se. Hours appeared to have been wasted bringing government officials for these meetings. In 2007 he moved to the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), where he did not have to be directly involved in budgetary processes until he was seconded to head the now defunct National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) in October 2012. At the NSCB, he faced hurdles delivering the major deliverables of the agency given the limited number of technical personnel and the DBM controls on hiring new permanent staff. As head of agency, he had to join other heads of government agencies during budget deliberations in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Although he was most thankful that the DBM and Congress appeared to be very supportive of the agency he headed, he observed that there were too many constraints in the entire budgetary process that do not allow government agencies to maximize the funds made available. He is glad to be relieved of responsibilities as there continue are bottlenecks at both the agencies and at DBM in spending budgets more efficiently. Bottlenecks in government Take the case of the PSA, an agency established in 2013 that consolidated staff of the NSCB with those of the National Statistics Office and two other statistics agencies. Even two years after its establishment, the PSA had yet to get an official nod from DBM on their proposed staffing patterns, despite having given this to the DBM. This delay in the staffing pattern approval clearly prevents PSA staff who would like to retire from getting their due incentives, and from hiring new staff to beef up the PSA's institutional capacity to deliver its mandate. It would not be surprising if the PSA's fund utilization is among the lowest within agencies of the National Economic and Development Authority. Government agencies also have internal bottlenecks not only in procurement and hiring processes, but also throughout many of their administrative processes. How long does it take agencies to pay salaries and wages of their non-permanent staff (job orders), whose services are provided from Maintenance and other Operating Agencies? These staffs on job orders also help agencies in delivering major final outputs, and yet they are treated as second class citizens, having to wait their turn, sometimes months just to get their wages. What people across government, whether from the courts, to the executive and to the legislative branches, need to have beyond a framework of accountability is a sense of urgency. If government does not develop plans to improve the MRT, the airports, the traffic, the slow and expensive wi-fi, and spend efficiently in executing these plans, how can we truly sustain and accelerate economic performance? How can government agencies ask for improved budgets next year when they have shown that they cannot even spend their current budgets (that supposedly were mostly released to them already at the first quarter of the year)? While much of the economic engine is private sector driven, government will clearly need to do better, much better in planning and execution. There are already risks in China's economy that may spell problems for the entire global economy's outlook. We need government and the private sector to keep investing in this country, and with a sense of urgency. And the leader we choose in 2016 will clearly need to provide solutions to our problems, so choose wisely, as we will get stuck with the next president for six years. This six-year period will be too short for a good president, but too long for a bad one. - Rappler.com Dr. Jose Ramon \"Toots\" Albert is a professional statistician who holds a PhD in Statistics from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

From October 2012 to February 2014, he was seconded to the now defunct National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) as the NSCB Secretary General.  Martin Joseph M.

With more â€œaccountabilityâ€ expected (i.e. particularly punishments for mistakes made), those involved in releasing budgets are undeniably getting too timid to spend because of fears of the dreaded reports of the Commission on Audit (COA), and the repercussions of having disallowances when one retires.</p> <p>The late Professor Angeles Buenaventura, former Dean of the then Statistics Center at UP Diliman, once pointed out â€œCOA rules are meant to run after the 5 percent engaged in crime, but the 95 percent suffer, and the 5 percent still manage to get away.â€</p> <p><strong>Figure 2. Growth of Public Expenditures : Q1 2010- Q1 2015 (in %) </strong></p> <p><em><strong>Source: Philippine Statistics Authority</strong></em></p> <p>Secretary Florencio â€œButchâ€ Abad of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) suggested that there are structural weaknesses in the bureaucracy â€œwhich were getting in the way of efficient spendingâ€ and accounting for <a href=\"http://whlnk.com/y4NE\">42 percent</a> of unutilized funds in government.</p> <p>Of the 2014 budget, 13 percent (or around P303 billion) was unspent. Government agencies seem unable to fully absorb available funds that are within and beyond their control, especially in infrastructure and capital outlay. While the DBM and Congress have been very supportive of budgets proposed by government agencies (in both the budget preparation and budget legislation phases of the government budget cycle), there has been a lack of absorption capacity among the government agencies for utilizing these funds. While budget allotments have been prepared and released much earlier than previous governments, utilization of government budgets has been reportedly weak.</p> <p><strong>Issues on infrastructure</strong></p> <p>This, however, is actually not a new problem. The countryâ€™s foremost public finance expert, Rosario â€œChatâ€ Manasan of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, has written about this even as far back as more than a decade ago in the context of <a href=\"http://whlnk.com/y4NW\"> infrastructure</a>.</p> <p>Manasan has also provided very detailed recommendations on improving bidding and procurement processes, management information systems, monitoring and evaluation systems for projects and programs, institutional strength (not only in the DBM, but in the government agencies themselves to improve internal control), to name a few.</p> <p>The current issue on infrastructure is the weak utilization of government funds for public construction. The growth drop started during the last quarter of 2013, with a -10.5% growth rate in public construction. The weak government spending for construction continues at present, with a -24.% drop in the first quarter of 2015 from a 17.5% growth rate last year (figure 3).</p> <p><strong>Figure 3. Growth Rates of Public Construction : Q1 2012 â€“ Q1 2015 (in %) </strong></p> <p>The decreasing budget utilization for public construction has direct repercussions on the infrastructure conditions of the country. If the government persists in spending little for construction, there is little hope for addressing the lack of mass transport system and public highways that make living and working in Metro Manila very challenging. Infrastructure planning and execution is jammed, just like the thousands of daily commuters and private vehicle owners in the Metro as they travel to school or work. </p> <p>Moreover, implementation of projects, especially on infrastructure, are clearly being slowed down also by judicial action ( temporary restraining orders on government projects with the private sector under the Public-Private Partnership) as well as some internal control processes (on procurement especially) within government agencies.</p> <p>Beyond budget execution, government may however need to re-examine the preparation, legislation, and the accountability processes of the entire budget cycle.</p> <p>Should DBM be focusing only on its budgetary role, or can it improve its management mandate (given that many DBM staff are accountants by profession)?</p> <p><strong>Figure 4. Processes of the Governmentâ€™s Budget Cycle in the Philippines : Budget Preparation, Budget Legislation, Budget Execution and Budget Accountability </strong></p> <p>One of the writers of this article has worked in government for more than one and a half decade. When he was hired in 1999 as a junior manager at a government agency that had a very small number of personnel (the then Statistical Research and Training Center), he lobbied for better budgets both within the agency and outside the agency. He lamented how an agency that was mandated to conduct statistical research and statistical training activities was being given very limited funds even for the regular purchase of knowledge materials and equipment to actually conduct research and training.</p> <p>At that time, he was informed about constraints on proposing improved budgetary outlays (so called â€œbudget ceilingsâ€) due to weak government resources. Occasionally he had to join meetings on the agency budget proposal at DBM, and deliberations at Congress on the budget (which sometimes took until wee hours of the morning). He noticed though that these budget deliberations were typically not even about the actual budget proposals <em>per se</em>. Hours appeared to have been wasted bringing government officials for these meetings.</p> <p>In 2007 he moved to the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), where he did not have to be directly involved in budgetary processes until he was seconded to head the now defunct National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) in October 2012. At the NSCB, he faced hurdles delivering the major deliverables of the agency given the <a href=\"http://whlnk.com/y4NR\">limited number of technical personnel</a> and the DBM controls on hiring new permanent staff.</p> <p>As head of agency, he had to join other heads of government agencies during budget deliberations in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Although he was most thankful that the DBM and Congress appeared to be very supportive of the agency he headed, he observed that there were too many constraints in the entire budgetary process that do not allow government agencies to maximize the funds made available. He is glad to be relieved of responsibilities as there continue are bottlenecks at both the agencies and at DBM in spending budgets more efficiently.</p> <p><strong>Bottlenecks in government</strong></p> <p>Take the case of the PSA, an agency established in 2013 that consolidated staff of the NSCB with those of the National Statistics Office and two other statistics agencies. Even two years after its establishment, the PSA had yet to get an official nod from DBM on their proposed staffing patterns, despite having given this to the DBM. This delay in the staffing pattern approval clearly prevents PSA staff who would like to retire from getting their due incentives, and from hiring new staff to beef up the PSAâ€™s institutional capacity to deliver its mandate. It would not be surprising if the PSAâ€™s fund utilization is among the lowest within agencies of the National Economic and Development Authority.</p> <p>Government agencies also have internal bottlenecks not only in procurement and hiring processes, but also throughout many of their administrative processes.</p> <p>How long does it take agencies to pay salaries and wages of their non-permanent staff (job orders), whose services are provided from Maintenance and other Operating Agencies? These staffs on job orders also help agencies in delivering major final outputs, and yet they are treated as second class citizens, having to wait their turn, sometimes months just to get their wages. What people across government, whether from the courts, to the executive and to the legislative branches, need to have beyond a framework of accountability is a sense of urgency.</p> <p>If government does not develop plans to improve the MRT, the airports, the traffic, the slow and expensive wi-fi, and spend efficiently in executing these plans, how can we truly sustain and accelerate economic performance?</p> <p>How can government agencies ask for improved budgets next year when they have shown that they cannot even spend their current budgets (that supposedly were mostly released to them already at the first quarter of the year)? While much of the economic engine is private sector driven, government will clearly need to do better, much better in planning and execution.</p> <p>There are already risks in Chinaâ€™s economy that may spell problems for the entire global economyâ€™s outlook. We need government and the private sector to keep investing in this country, and with a sense of urgency.</p> <p>And the leader we choose in 2016 will clearly need to provide solutions to our problems, so choose wisely, as we will get stuck with the next president for six years. This six-year period will be too short for a good president, but too long for a bad one. <strong>â€“ Rappler.com</strong></p> <p><em>Dr. Jose Ramon \"Toots\" Albert is a professional statistician who holds a PhD in Statistics from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Hopefully, the next administration, whoever that might be, it can grow at a faster rate,Â” Recto said.Recto also commended the Aquino administration for reducing \"a bit\" the poverty incidence and malnutrition through the help of the conditional cast transfer (CCT) or Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps).Â”This is one of the challenges, the inclusive growth, to reduce poverty incidence but malnutrition is also going down based on the latest survey,Â” Recto said.President Aquino recently met with possible 2016 presidential candidates, including Senator Grace Poe and Interior Secretary Manuel \"Mar\" Roxas, to stress the need to continue the reform agenda he started five years ago.The President has said he will announce his anointed one in the 2016 presidential race after his last State-of-the -Nation Address (SONA) on July 27.

    "text": "What if Sen. Lacson's statement about the involvement of the majority of senators was true?   The late U.S. senator Henry Clay, Sr. once compared the government to a trust instrument.   Sen. Clay once remarked that public officials and leaders are the trustees of the people and both the trust (the government) and the trustees are created for the benefit of the people. He made this comparison in his speech in 1829 when the U.S. Senate was only 40 years old (it was first convened in 1789).   In the Philippines, a former member of the Philippine Senate, Sen. Panfilo \"Ping\" Lacson warned that the 24-member senate in the Philippines might collapse if the contents of Janet Lim-Napoles' affidavit was made public. The affidavit allegedly linked majority of the current and former Philippine lawmakers in the pork barrel scandal.  \"You can just imagine that if this list is made public and public trust in the Senate is eroded further, wouldn't it have a national security implication?,\" said Lacson recently.  The Philippine Senate traces its roots in the occupation and colonial administration of the Philippines by the U.S.   Under the Philippine Organic Act (from 1907 to 1916), the Philippine Commission headed by the Governor-General of the Philippines served as the upper chamber of the Philippine Legislature and the Philippine Assembly served as the elected lower house. The governor-general was tasked to exercise executive enforcement powers.   It was only after World War II and upon the granting of independence by the U.S. to the Philippines in 1946 did the Philippine Senate acquire power to ratify treaties.   The role of the senate to the young Philippine Republic from 1946 to 1972 was also seen and considered as pivotal in many respects.   The members of upper chamber were elected at large by the entire Philippine electorate, similar to the electorate that voted for the president and the vice-president of the Philippines.   The senate was seen and viewed by many politicians, the electorate, and the general public as a fertile training ground for national leaders and statesmen.   It was a launching stage and pad for those who aspired for the presidency of the Philippines--- from Manuel L. Quezon to President Benigno C. Aquino III. Other former senators who were successful in campaigning and getting elected to the presidency include Jose P. Laurel, Sergio OsmeÃ±a, Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, Carlos P. Garcia, Ferdinand E. Marcos, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.   What would happen if the current senate collapses because of the loss of trust from the Filipino people due to the involvement and collusion of many lawmakers in the pork barrel scam? What if Sen. Lacson's statement about the involvement of the majority of senators was true?   This situation for sure (the collapse of the senate due to betrayal and lack of public trust) will have a national security implication.   As the body that has power to ratify treaties and considering the territorial tensions in the region, as well as in the international front, an impotent senate will do no good for the nation. A  In the domestic front, an emasculated senate cannot move and push forward the reforms in the government--- including the appointments of cabinet and key government officials, passing of legislative bills and the national budget, and the cementing and finalizing the peace accord with the MILF.   What happens to the senate in the coming months will also have an implication to the 2016 presidential and senatorial elections.   But a possible massive internal cleansing in the Philippine government can also be a blessing for the Filipino people.   Every nation deserves a government and leaders that can be trusted.   Following the logic of Sen. Clay's statement, Filipinos deserve a better government and line-up of leaders and elected officials. Simply said, Filipinos deserve a government that they can be trust.

    "text": "WASHINGTON - Congress plunged the nation into a partial government shutdown yesterday, forcing some 800,000 federal workers off the job as a protracted dispute over President Barack Obama's signature health care law reached the boiling point. Obama readied a midday statement to the nation while Democrats and Republicans at the Capitol blamed each other for the first shutdown in nearly two decades.  \"Closed\" signs and barricades sprang up early yesterday at the Lincoln Memorial and other monuments, and the National Park Service was turning off 45 fountains around the capital city. National parks from Acadia in Maine to Denali in Alaska followed suit, as did many federal workplaces.  Agencies like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency were virtually shuttered.  But people classified as essential government employees -- such as air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents and most food inspectors -- continued to work. So did members of the military and employees whose jobs are financed through fees, such as State Department workers who issue passports and visas.  In a letter to federal workers, Obama lamented that they have become \"punching bags\" in a partisan fight.  With the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate at stalemate, it was unclear how long the shutdown would last, or whom the public would blame for unanswered phones and locked doors. Whether students shut out of Smithsonian museums or homebuyers wanting government-backed loans, some Americans already were filling the pinch and the effects were expected to spread.  World ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1    The economic toll on a fragile economy was a worry, too. More than a third of the federal civilian workforce was furloughed -- equivalent to the combined workforce of Target, General Motors, Exxon and Google -- and many do jobs that private businesses rely on.  The Senate early yesterday rejected the House's call to form a negotiating committee to resolve the deadlock over health care and financing the government.  Moments after the vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., laid full blame on House Republicans, declaring, \"The government is closed because of the irrationality of what's going on on the other side of the Capitol.\"  But Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said GOP lawmakers were listening to constituents who want to \"stop the runaway train called the federal government.\" Their message, he said, is \"Stay strong.\"  Obama communications director Jennifer Palmieri told MSNBC that the White House was open to changes in the health care law in future negotiations, but not as part of passing a budget bill. She compared that to negotiating with \"a gun pointed to your head.\"  Obama was meeting with citizens signing up for his health care program on the opening day of enrollment before making a statement about the shutdown in the Rose Garden.  In the House, conservative Rep. Marsha Blackburn predicted the standoff might drag on for days if Obama and Senate Democrats refused to bargain. \"People are going to realize they can live with a lot less government,\" Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News.  Another Republican, Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia, whose Norfolk-area district includes tens of thousands of military members and their families, tweeted \"We fought the good fight. Time for a clean CR\" -- referring to a continuing resolution that would reopen the government without addressing health care.  The health care law itself was unaffected yesterday as enrollment opened for millions of people shopping for medical insurance.  It was the first shutdown since a budget battle between Republicans in Congress and Democratic President Bill Clinton in the winter of 1995-1996.  Congress itself was affected. Some staffers were furloughed and hearings were postponed. The US Capitol canceled tours not personally led by lawmakers. Democratic Sen. Tom Carper sent an email to his Delaware constituents telling them not to expect responses to their emails and phone calls.  Lawmakers and the president were still getting paid, however, at a rate totaling more than $250,000 per day. Most of the nation's 2.1 million civilian federal workers were either working with their pay suspended or on unpaid furlough.  The Supreme Court operated as usual, even welcoming tour groups, but was at risk of running low on money if the shutdown lingers beyond Friday.  Tourists were left with few other government options. The Smithsonian website displayed a red banner noting that \"all Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo are closed.\" On the zoo's website, panda mom Mei Xiang could be seen snuggling with her weeks-old cub through the morning, until the feed was abruptly cut off around 8 a.m. Care of the animals will continue behind the scenes.  The White House was operating with a skeletal staff. A groundskeeper working outside yesterday morning at daybreak said he was doing the job normally handled by four workers.  Given the shutdown, White House officials were discussing whether Obama should change plans for a trip to Asia scheduled to begin Saturday.  The military will be paid under legislation freshly signed by Obama, but paychecks for other federal workers will be withheld until the impasse is broken. Federal workers were told to report to their jobs for a half-day but to perform only shutdown tasks like changing email greetings and closing down agencies' Internet sites.  The self-funded Postal Service will continue to operate and the government will continue to pay Social Security benefits and Medicare and Medicaid fees to doctors on time.  The Senate twice on Monday rejected House-passed bills that first sought to delay key portions of the 2010 \"Obamacare\" law, then to delay the law's requirement that millions of people buy medical insurance. Early yesterday the House named negotiators for what would be a Senate-House conference to work out differences on the bill. The Senate rejected that gambit.  As the standoff continued, some Republicans voiced nervousness.  Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma called the shutdown \"a big mistake.\" Interviewed on MSNBC, Cole called on House and Senate negotiations to end the impasse.  The order directing federal agencies to \"execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations\" was issued by White House Budget Director Sylvia Burwell just before midnight Monday.  The spending bill at the center of the fight would fund the government only through Nov. 15 if the Senate gets its way or until Dec. 15 if the House does -- and even an agreement to reopen government temporarily might do little to fix the underlying standoff.  House Speaker John Boehner had sought to avoid the shutdown and engineer passage of a \"clean\" temporary spending bill. But tea party activists mobilized by freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, mounted a campaign to seize the must-do measure in an effort to derail Obamacare.",

    "content_html": "<div> <div><p>WASHINGTON - Congress plunged the nation into a partial government shutdown yesterday, forcing some 800,000 federal workers off the job as a protracted dispute over President Barack Obama's signature health care law reached the boiling point. Obama readied a midday statement to the nation while Democrats and Republicans at the Capitol blamed each other for the first shutdown in nearly two decades.</p> <p> \"Closed\" signs and barricades sprang up early yesterday at the Lincoln Memorial and other monuments, and the National Park Service was turning off 45 fountains around the capital city. National parks from Acadia in Maine to Denali in Alaska followed suit, as did many federal workplaces.</p> <p> Agencies like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency were virtually shuttered.</p> <p> But people classified as essential government employees â€” such as air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents and most food inspectors â€” continued to work. So did members of the military and employees whose jobs are financed through fees, such as State Department workers who issue passports and visas.</p> <p> In a letter to federal workers, Obama lamented that they have become \"punching bags\" in a partisan fight.</p> <p> With the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate at stalemate, it was unclear how long the shutdown would last, or whom the public would blame for unanswered phones and locked doors. Whether students shut out of Smithsonian museums or homebuyers wanting government-backed loans, some Americans already were filling the pinch and the effects were expected to spread.</p><div> <div> World ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: 1 </div> </div> <p> The economic toll on a fragile economy was a worry, too. More than a third of the federal civilian workforce was furloughed â€” equivalent to the combined workforce of Target, General Motors, Exxon and Google â€” and many do jobs that private businesses rely on.</p> <p> The Senate early yesterday rejected the House's call to form a negotiating committee to resolve the deadlock over health care and financing the government.</p> <p> Moments after the vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., laid full blame on House Republicans, declaring, \"The government is closed because of the irrationality of what's going on on the other side of the Capitol.\"</p> <p> But Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said GOP lawmakers were listening to constituents who want to \"stop the runaway train called the federal government.\" Their message, he said, is \"Stay strong.\"</p> <p> Obama communications director Jennifer Palmieri told MSNBC that the White House was open to changes in the health care law in future negotiations, but not as part of passing a budget bill. She compared that to negotiating with \"a gun pointed to your head.\"</p> <p> Obama was meeting with citizens signing up for his health care program on the opening day of enrollment before making a statement about the shutdown in the Rose Garden.</p> <p> In the House, conservative Rep. Marsha Blackburn predicted the standoff might drag on for days if Obama and Senate Democrats refused to bargain. \"People are going to realize they can live with a lot less government,\" Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News.</p> <p> Another Republican, Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia, whose Norfolk-area district includes tens of thousands of military members and their families, tweeted \"We fought the good fight. Time for a clean CR\" â€” referring to a continuing resolution that would reopen the government without addressing health care.</p> <p> The health care law itself was unaffected yesterday as enrollment opened for millions of people shopping for medical insurance.</p> <p> It was the first shutdown since a budget battle between Republicans in Congress and Democratic President Bill Clinton in the winter of 1995-1996.</p> <p> Congress itself was affected. Some staffers were furloughed and hearings were postponed. The US Capitol canceled tours not personally led by lawmakers. Democratic Sen. Tom Carper sent an email to his Delaware constituents telling them not to expect responses to their emails and phone calls.</p> <p> Lawmakers and the president were still getting paid, however, at a rate totaling more than $250,000 per day. Most of the nation's 2.1 million civilian federal workers were either working with their pay suspended or on unpaid furlough.</p> <p> The Supreme Court operated as usual, even welcoming tour groups, but was at risk of running low on money if the shutdown lingers beyond Friday.</p> <p> Tourists were left with few other government options. The Smithsonian website displayed a red banner noting that \"all Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo are closed.\" On the zoo's website, panda mom Mei Xiang could be seen snuggling with her weeks-old cub through the morning, until the feed was abruptly cut off around 8 a.m. Care of the animals will continue behind the scenes.</p> <p> The White House was operating with a skeletal staff. A groundskeeper working outside yesterday morning at daybreak said he was doing the job normally handled by four workers.</p> <p> Given the shutdown, White House officials were discussing whether Obama should change plans for a trip to Asia scheduled to begin Saturday.</p> <p> The military will be paid under legislation freshly signed by Obama, but paychecks for other federal workers will be withheld until the impasse is broken. Federal workers were told to report to their jobs for a half-day but to perform only shutdown tasks like changing email greetings and closing down agencies' Internet sites.</p> <p> The self-funded Postal Service will continue to operate and the government will continue to pay Social Security benefits and Medicare and Medicaid fees to doctors on time.</p> <p> The Senate twice on Monday rejected House-passed bills that first sought to delay key portions of the 2010 \"Obamacare\" law, then to delay the law's requirement that millions of people buy medical insurance. Early yesterday the House named negotiators for what would be a Senate-House conference to work out differences on the bill. The Senate rejected that gambit.</p> <p> As the standoff continued, some Republicans voiced nervousness.</p> <p> Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma called the shutdown \"a big mistake.\" Interviewed on MSNBC, Cole called on House and Senate negotiations to end the impasse.</p> <p> The order directing federal agencies to \"execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations\" was issued by White House Budget Director Sylvia Burwell just before midnight Monday.</p> <p> The spending bill at the center of the fight would fund the government only through Nov. 15 if the Senate gets its way or until Dec. 15 if the House does â€” and even an agreement to reopen government temporarily might do little to fix the underlying standoff.</p> <p> House Speaker John Boehner had sought to avoid the shutdown and engineer passage of a \"clean\" temporary spending bill. But tea party activists mobilized by freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, mounted a campaign to seize the must-do measure in an effort to derail Obamacare.</p> </div> </div>"

    "text": "Radio commentator Rizalito David on Monday filed with the Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET) a memorandum of exhibits detailing all the evidence his camp has presented in connection with the disqualification case filed against Sen. Grace Poe. In his 51-page memorandum of exhibits, David, a defeated senatorial candidate in 2013 elections, maintained that Poe should be ousted from her Senate seat on the ground that she is not a natural-born Filipino citizen. \"This is a reiteration of what we have mentioned during the oral arguments...Ang pinapakita namin dito, talagang walang local law or even customary international law na magju-justify na indeed si Grace Poe-Llamanzares ay isang natural-born Filipino citizen,\" David told reporters after the filing of his memorandum. In August, David filed before the SET a quo warranto petition that seeks to unseat Poe in the Senate on the grounds that she allegedly violated Section 3, Article VI of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, which requires a candidate to be a natural-born citizen. During oral arguments on David's petition late last month, SET chairman and Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio opined that based on international customary law, Poe can only be considered a naturalized Filipino citizen and not a natural-born citizen, unless the senator can prove that either of her parents is a Filipino. \"If tomorrow you happen to find out by DNA matching that your parent is Filipino, you can still prove that you are natural-born,\" Carpio said. In his memorandum, David cited a total of 39 pieces of evidence that would supposedly prove that Poe defrauded the government for allegedly making it appear that she is a natural-born Filipino citizen when she filed her certificate of candidacy for the 2013 elections. David said among his pieces of evidence against Poe include a memorandum of cancellation of the Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR) issued by the Bureau of Immigration in favor of Poe in 2006. David said the memorandum was invalid as it was neither signed nor approved by then-BI commissioner Alipio Fernandez, Jr., thus the senator was still considered an American citizen when she filed her certificate of candidacy. David also cited as exhibit the birth certificate of Poe dated May 4, 2006, which he said \"bears glaring false entries,\" among them the statement that her \"biological\" parents are Jesusa L. Sonora also known as Susan Roces and Ronald Allan K. Poe also known as Fernando Poe Jr. (FPJ), the late actor. The birth certificate also supposedly stated that FPJ was still alive at the time the certificate was recorded with the Office of the City Civil Registrar of Iloilo City. FPJ died on December 14, 2004. David also cited as evidence the \"patently null and void\" decision of the Municipal Court of San Juance, Rizal, who heard and granted the adoption of Poe by FPJ and Susan Roces. David said the Municipal Court of San Juan has no jurisdiction over the petition as Poe was found in Jaro, Iloilo. David also included in his memorandum of exhibits a copy of Poe's \"oath/affirmation of renunciation of nationality of United States.\" He said that based on this document, Poe only renounced her US citizenship on July 12, 2011. David further said that a copy of Poe's \"certificate of loss of nationality of the United States\" would also prove that \"the respondent's renunciation of USA citizenship was approved by the US government only on February 3, 2012.\" \"To me, as a sense of decency and ethics and morality, she should not have run for senator kasi she once changed her citizenship [from Filipino to American],\" David said. David also maintained that Poe's husband and two kids remain American citizens until now. \"That's another case ng lack of decency and ethics. You are now a senator of the Republic and yet the entire family is American citizen,\" he said. GMA News Online was trying to get a reaction from Poe as of posting time. --KBK, GMA News",

    "text": "THE Poe-Escudero campaign team should somehow rethink its campaign message the next time they come for a sortie in Cebu. Why? Because there are still those who have not forgotten that around a decade ago, Grace Poe accused Cebuanos of having cheated her father Fernando Poe Jr., popularly known as FPJ. She should know by now that was not true. GMA won in Cebu last 2004 because FPJ had no local political leader with a clear political organization at the grassroots. The big names in Cebu provincial politics then-Gwen Garcia, John-john OsmeÃ±a, Junnie Martinez, Nito Durano, and Eddie Gullas-supported GMA. There was no cheating. The opposition press conference showing supposed witnesses of alleged electoral fraud was exposed as a sham by then NBI director Esmeralda. This issue was not brought up in 2013 because both the administration and opposition coalitions carried Poe as a common candidate for senator. The year 2016, however, is different. Sen. Grace Poe is running for president. In her Cebu sorties so far, she glossed over the fact that once upon a time she called us, Cebuanos, cheats. I hope it is not too late for her to say sorry. The election is still in May next year. But she already announced her intention to seek the presidency. The filing of certificates of candidacy starts on Oct. 12. An \"I am sorry\" now smacks of politics. An \"I am sorry\" now won't sound sincere. Sen. Grace Poe likewise needs to refine her line about pursuing her father's legacy. FPJ was basically an actor, not a politician. FPJ was a great actor. But no, he was not a politician. And he failed in his bid to become president. Grace, on the other hand, is now a senator with a traditional politician as an adviser and vice presidential candidate in Sen. Chiz Escudero. They are running under the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC), the party formed and led by Danding Cojuangco. We all know who Danding was during the Marcos dictatorship. I find it ironic that it is actually former DILG secretary Mar Roxas, who is the grandson of a Philippine president, Manuel Roxas--the first elected resident of MalacaÃ±ang after World War 2. Mar's father, pre-martial law senator Gerry Roxas, was an opposition giant against the Marcos dictatorship along with Ninoy Aquino, Pepe Diokno, Serging OsmeÃ±a, Jovy Salonga and Lorenzo \"Tanny\" TaÃ±ada Sr. But Mar is not talking about the distant past. He is talking about pursuing P-Noy's Daang Matuwid. *** The Poe-Escudero camp seemed to have won a local big political leader when Bakkud big boss and Danao City Mayor Nito Durano joined the two senators during a press conference last week. After all, Sen. Escudero and Cong. Ace Durano are NPC members. Let's however refrain from making hasty conclusions. The Duranos are astute political players and local considerations play a big role in their political decisions. I can still remember in 2013 when President Aquino and Secretary Roxas graced an event organized by Bakud. The behind-the-scene meetings during that public event sealed the Bakud-LP alliance. Nothing of that nature transpired with the Poe-Escudero camp last week. I am more interested, nevertheless, in knowing what's going on in the camp of gubernatorial wannabe Winston Garcia, the One Cebu Party, the NPC and the camp of Senator Grace and Chiz. *** Councilor Gerry Carillo, when interviewed by Ruphil BaÃ±oc late last week, said Mayor Mike Rama can best answer questions about the reported P112,000 financial assistance for the Abella clan reunion. This arose after BaÃ±oc revealed the existence of a document signed by the mayor specifically listing the controversial item. The councilor earlier tried to take the cudgels in behalf of the Rama administration insisting the assistance was for 75 families the City honored. However, he backtracked when showed a document obtained by dyHP. ***  Councilor Margot OsmeÃ±a explained the BOPK majority's deferment of its approval of the supplemental budget as the prudent approach, considering the case for declaratory relief filed by a taxpayer on the recent sale of a South Road Properties (SRP) lot. Pro-Rama loyalists, as expected, branded the move as \"babag.\" The way I look at it, though, Mayor Mike Rama's legal team needs to demonstrate the case against the SRP sale is actually weak by getting it dismissed as soon as possible. If not, it will only prove prudence as correct after all. (@anol_cebu in Twitter)  Published in the Sun.Star Cebu newspaper on October 05, 2015.

    "content_html": "<div><div><div><p>THE Poe-Escudero campaign team should somehow rethink its campaign message the next time they come for a sortie in Cebu.</p> <p>Why? Because there are still those who have not forgotten that around a decade ago, Grace Poe accused Cebuanos of having cheated her father Fernando Poe Jr., popularly known as FPJ.</p> <p>She should know by now that was not true. GMA won in Cebu last 2004 because FPJ had no local political leader with a clear political organization at the grassroots. The big names in Cebu provincial politics thenâ€“Gwen Garcia, John-john OsmeÃ±a, Junnie Martinez, Nito Durano, and Eddie Gullasâ€“supported GMA.</p> <p>There was no cheating. The opposition press conference showing supposed witnesses of alleged electoral fraud was exposed as a sham by then NBI director Esmeralda.</p> <p>This issue was not brought up in 2013 because both the administration and opposition coalitions carried Poe as a common candidate for senator.</p> <p>The year 2016, however, is different. Sen. Grace Poe is running for president. In her Cebu sorties so far, she glossed over the fact that once upon a time she called us, Cebuanos, cheats.</p> <p>I hope it is not too late for her to say sorry. The election is still in May next year. But she already announced her intention to seek the presidency. The filing of certificates of candidacy starts on Oct. 12. An â€œI am sorryâ€ now smacks of politics. An â€œI am sorryâ€ now wonâ€™t sound sincere.</p> <p>Sen. Grace Poe likewise needs to refine her line about pursuing her fatherâ€™s legacy. FPJ was basically an actor, not a politician. FPJ was a great actor. But no, he was not a politician. And he failed in his bid to become president.</p> <p>Grace, on the other hand, is now a senator with a traditional politician as an adviser and vice presidential candidate in Sen. Chiz Escudero. They are running under the Nationalist Peopleâ€™s Coalition (NPC), the party formed and led by Danding Cojuangco. We all know who Danding was during the Marcos dictatorship.</p> <p>I find it ironic that it is actually former DILG secretary Mar Roxas, who is the grandson of a Philippine president, Manuel Roxas--the first elected resident of MalacaÃ±ang after World War 2. Marâ€™s father, pre-martial law senator Gerry Roxas, was an opposition giant against the Marcos dictatorship along with Ninoy Aquino, Pepe Diokno, Serging OsmeÃ±a, Jovy Salonga and Lorenzo â€œTannyâ€ TaÃ±ada Sr. But Mar is not talking about the distant past. He is talking about pursuing P-Noyâ€™s Daang Matuwid.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The Poe-Escudero camp seemed to have won a local big political leader when Bakkud big boss and Danao City Mayor Nito Durano joined the two senators during a press conference last week. After all, Sen. Escudero and Cong. Ace Durano are NPC members.</p> <p>Letâ€™s however refrain from making hasty conclusions. The Duranos are astute political players and local considerations play a big role in their political decisions. I can still remember in 2013 when President Aquino and Secretary Roxas graced an event organized by Bakud. The behind-the-scene meetings during that public event sealed the Bakud-LP alliance.</p> <p>Nothing of that nature transpired with the Poe-Escudero camp last week. I am more interested, nevertheless, in knowing whatâ€™s going on in the camp of gubernatorial wannabe Winston Garcia, the One Cebu Party, the NPC and the camp of Senator Grace and Chiz.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Councilor Gerry Carillo, when interviewed by Ruphil BaÃ±oc late last week, said Mayor Mike Rama can best answer questions about the reported P112,000 financial assistance for the Abella clan reunion. This arose after BaÃ±oc revealed the existence of a document signed by the mayor specifically listing the controversial item.</p> <p>The councilor earlier tried to take the cudgels in behalf of the Rama administration insisting the assistance was for 75 families the City honored. However, he backtracked when showed a document obtained by dyHP.</p> <p>*** </p> <p>Councilor Margot OsmeÃ±a explained the BOPK majorityâ€™s deferment of its approval of the supplemental budget as the prudent approach, considering the case for declaratory relief filed by a taxpayer on the recent sale of a South Road Properties (SRP) lot. Pro-Rama loyalists, as expected, branded the move as â€œbabag.â€</p> <p>The way I look at it, though, Mayor Mike Ramaâ€™s legal team needs to demonstrate the case against the SRP sale is actually weak by getting it dismissed as soon as possible. If not, it will only prove prudence as correct after all.</p> <p><strong>(@anol_cebu in Twitter)</strong></p> </div></div></div> <p><strong>Published in the Sun.Star Cebu newspaper on October 05, 2015.</strong></p> <p>Latest issues of <strong>Sun.Star Cebu</strong> also available on your mobile phones, laptops, and tablets.

    "text": "Patricio N. Abinales      Published 5:39 PM, October 03, 2015   Updated 7:12 PM, October 03, 2015       As the election fever heats up, and the contending coalitions gather support wherever they think this is available and feasible, observers always get drawn to the personalities rather than the party programs. This is quite expected, given that our political culture gives premium to the individual as the prime determinant on how power is attained, legitimized, and protected. Oddly this kind of analysis applies to both the Left and the Right. Hence, here you have a Marcos whose rise to power was iginuhit ng tadhana (fate); there you have a Santa Corazon who brought us out of the authoritarian darkness into the democratic light. Here you have \"Professor\" Nur Misuari leading the march to a Bangsamoro Eden, there you have \"Professor\" Joema Sison wielding the baton as he leads a dwindling communist population to the Pulang Silangan (Red East). Of course, this is not unique to our system. This fetish for the individual is what drives American politics these days too. The days of the machine politicians (Howard Taft, Huey Long, the Daleys of Chicago) and of the patrician presidents (Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt) are now faint memories. In their place is the ament Sarah Palin, the cretin Donald Trump and comrades Ted Cruz, Marc Rubio. And there are the political families: the Bushies and the Clintons. How much the Plutonian world American politics has affected our own is a matter for scholars to resolve. For now it is enough to say that when it comes to personality-centered politics, hindi tayo nag-iisa (we are not alone)! Poe and the presidency Pushed to the margins, however, are those who want a smarter, much better explanation of the social forces behind our political games. These days, there is that need to explain the rise and popularity of Senator Grace Poe and her quest for the presidency. (READ: TIMELINE: Grace Poe's citizenship, residency) A brief glance at what pundits, public intellectuals, and the professors have written about here exhibits a certain degree of crudeness. All that appears to matter for many is her national affiliations: did she renounce her American citizenship just in time to qualify for the presidential candidacy? A good number say she did not, making her ineligible to run. She left the country, became an American, recited the Pledge of Allegiance, and lived there for a large portion of her life. Her mentality is American and in her soul, and so are her loyalties deep down. This is the spin that her critics have been putting out. There is something disingenuous here, and it has to do with our schizophrenic view of elections. These commentators complain of how the elite manipulate elections and how, as a result, voting is not really an expression of the popular will. It is a circus where the botante are paid off by competing party operatives, depending on who offers the highest bid. It is a spectacle where what matters most is how a candidate with a Sorbonne credential is good at hip-hop, or how the arthritic politico can sing like Bruno Mars. There is nothing to be had for any serious democrat in Philippine elections. The Filipino Ayatollah put it well when he described our parties as like Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola - hard to spot the difference. So when Grace's critics assail her for not being loyal to this national ritual and the post that she will hold if she wins, they are contradicting themselves with the message that voting is something sacred and serious. The people are trying to make fools out of us by making us believe that our ballot counts.  Double standard The moral outrage over Grace's political infidelity does not extend to their manok (bet), the Vice, the dead dictator's son, and the icon of Daang Matuwid 2. With these characters, nuance is the operative term: yes he may be corrupt, but look at what Vice has done to Makati; the son should not inherit the sins of the father even he continues to defend the latter's repressive and patrimonial regime; and the heir to the presidential throne should not be judged negatively because his professionalism and corporate life have mitigated his oligarchic pedigree. However, if these critics think elections are nothing but games of the elite, and, because Grace the American is one of them, why insist that their manoks are the exemption from the norm? Why are the Vice, Bongbong or Mar made to look different from the spoils of men and women who dominate the circus? Why not add them to the pool of clowns that had now expanded to include Senator Poe? Alas, here is double standard at its best. Elections are serious if it involves your manok; it is nothing but a spectacle when the centerpiece is Grace Poe. But, voters can see through what these anti-Poe social forces are broadcasting. The surveys by the two most credible polling groups (Pulse Asia and the Social Weather Stations) suggest that these political groups will be unable to draw the people away from the Senator's muted charm. So they might accept these politicians' bribes, but I doubt if they will then march to the polling booth and write down the names of the Vice, Bong, or Mar. They will accept the money and vote Poe. *** Steve Rood of Asia Foundation and someone whose work with the Bangsamoro I most admire, sent this nice note correcting my comments about Churchill and conservatism in the last piece. Steve wrote: \"It is often wrongly ascribed to Churchill. The phrase originated with Francois Guisot (1787-1874): 'Not to be a republican at twenty is proof of want of heart; to be one at thirty is proof of want of head.' It was revived by French Premier Georges Clemenceau (1841-1929): 'Not to be a socialist at twenty is proof of want of heart; to be one at thirty is proof of want of head.'\" Thanks Steve. *** Patricio Abinales is an OFW",

Oddly this kind of analysis applies to both the Left and the Right.</p> <p>Hence, here you have a Marcos whose rise to power was <em>iginuhit ng tadhana </em>(fate); there you have a Santa Corazon who brought us out of the authoritarian darkness into the democratic light. Here you have \"Professor\" Nur Misuari leading the march to a Bangsamoro Eden, there you have â€œProfessorâ€ Joema Sison wielding the baton as he leads a dwindling communist population to the <em>Pulang Silangan </em>(Red East).</p> <p>Of course, this is not unique to our system. This fetish for the individual is what drives American politics these days too. The days of the machine politicians (Howard Taft, Huey Long, the Daleys of Chicago) and of the patrician presidents (Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt) are now faint memories. In their place is the ament Sarah Palin, the cretin Donald Trump and comrades Ted Cruz, Marc Rubio. And there are the political families: the Bushies and the Clintons.</p> <p>How much the Plutonian world American politics has affected our own is a matter for scholars to resolve. For now it is enough to say that when it comes to personality-centered politics, <em>hindi tayo nag-iisa </em>(we are not alone)!</p> <p><strong>Poe and the presidency</strong></p> <p>Pushed to the margins, however, are those who want a smarter, much better explanation of the social forces behind our political games. These days, there is that need to explain the rise and popularity of Senator Grace Poe and her quest for the presidency. (READ: <a href=\"http://whlnk.com/exZ5\">TIMELINE: Grace Poe's citizenship, residency</a>)</p> <p>A brief glance at what pundits, public intellectuals, and the professors have written about here exhibits a certain degree of crudeness. All that appears to matter for many is her national affiliations: did she renounce her American citizenship just in time to qualify for the presidential candidacy? A good number say she did not, making her ineligible to run.</p> <p>She left the country, <a href=\"http://whlnk.com/uYM5\">became an American</a>, recited the Pledge of Allegiance, and lived there for a large portion of her life. Her mentality is American and in her soul, and so are her loyalties deep down. This is the spin that her critics have been putting out.</p> <p>There is something disingenuous here, and it has to do with our schizophrenic view of elections. These commentators complain of how the elite manipulate elections and how, as a result, voting is not really an expression of the popular will. It is a circus where the <em>botante</em> are paid off by competing party operatives, depending on who offers the highest bid.</p> <p>It is a spectacle where what matters most is how a candidate with a Sorbonne credential is good at hip-hop, or how the arthritic <em>politico </em>can sing like Bruno Mars. There is nothing to be had for any serious democrat in Philippine elections. The Filipino Ayatollah put it well when he described our parties as like Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola â€“ hard to spot the difference.</p> <p>So when Graceâ€™s critics assail her for not being loyal to this national ritual and the post that she will hold if she wins, they are contradicting themselves with the message that voting is something sacred and serious. The people are trying to make fools out of us by making us believe that our ballot counts. </p> <p><strong>Double standard</strong></p> <p>The moral outrage over Graceâ€™s political infidelity does not extend to their <em>manok </em>(bet), the Vice, the dead dictatorâ€™s son, and the icon of <em>Daang Matuwid 2</em>. With these characters, nuance is the operative term: yes he may be corrupt, but look at what Vice has done to Makati; the son should not inherit the sins of the father even he continues to defend the latterâ€™s repressive and patrimonial regime; and the heir to the presidential throne should not be judged negatively because his professionalism and corporate life have mitigated his oligarchic pedigree.</p> <p>However, if these critics think elections are nothing but games of the elite, and, because Grace the American is one of them, why insist that their <em>manoks</em> are the exemption from the norm? Why are the Vice, Bongbong or Mar made to look different from the spoils of men and women who dominate the circus? Why not add them to the pool of clowns that had now expanded to include Senator Poe?</p> <p>Alas, here is double standard at its best. Elections are serious if it involves your <em>manok</em>; it is nothing but a spectacle when the centerpiece is Grace Poe.</p> <p>But, voters can see through what these anti-Poe social forces are broadcasting. The surveys by the two most credible polling groups (<a href=\"http://whlnk.com/uB4K\">Pulse Asia</a> and the <a href=\"http://whlnk.com/uZZi\">Social Weather Stations</a>) suggest that these political groups will be unable to draw the people away from the Senatorâ€™s muted charm.</p> <p>So they might accept these politicians' bribes, but I doubt if they will then march to the polling booth and write down the names of the Vice, Bong, or Mar. They will accept the money and vote Poe.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Steve Rood of Asia Foundation and someone whose work with the Bangsamoro I most admire, sent this nice note correcting my comments about Churchill and conservatism in the last piece. Steve wrote: â€œIt is often wrongly ascribed to Churchill. The phrase originated with Francois Guisot (1787-1874): â€˜Not to be a republican at twenty is proof of want of heart; to be one at thirty is proof of want of head.â€™ It was revived by French Premier Georges Clemenceau (1841-1929): â€˜Not to be a socialist at twenty is proof of want of heart; to be one at thirty is proof of want of head.â€™â€ Thanks Steve.</em></p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Patricio Abinales is an OFW</em></p>"

Poe and her lawyers assured the deep pockets that if the case enters into the period of oral arguments, they had all the firepower to make short work of David and his lawyer (he has one lawyer, Manuelito Luna). Instead, the duel at the tribunal last Monday turned out to be a real contest. The oral arguments were reminiscent of David's duel with Goliath in the Bible. Rizalito's slingshot had some real stones to fire. Poe's lawyers had only blanks for bullets. David's counsel forcefully presented their main argument that when Ms. Grace Poe- Llamanzarees ran for senator in the May 2013 election, she did not possess the legal qualification of being a natural-born Filipino citizen. Her claim of being a foundling does not help her. It rather underscores the fact that her parentage is unknown. She must still prove that she is a natural-born Filipino. The counter-argument of Ms. Poe's two lawyers was to claim that under customary international law, Ms. Poe, as a foundling, should enjoy the presumption of being a natural-born citizen of the Philippines. They glossed over the question of who her biological parents are. Poe naturalized, not natural-born, citizen Poe's counsel projected that the SET hearing would be a long drawn-out affair, and intended to dribble the proceedings so they would stretch over weeks and even months. That outlook changed dramatically when Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, SET chairman, weighed in with his questions and comments. You could feel the ship tilting in favor of petitioner Rizalito David as people comprehended what they were hearing. Justice Carpio logically and clearly spelled what he believes is the legal status today of Senator Poe, with respect to her citizenship. Carpio said Poe can be considered a Filipino under international customary law, but only as a naturalized citizen, not as a natural-born citizen. He cited Article 4, Section 1 of the 1935 Constitution that he said should apply to Poe. The fifth paragraph of the constitutional provision considers as citizens of the Philippines \"those who are naturalized in accordance with law.\" \"We do not follow international customary law because our Constitution has primacy,\" Carpio explained. \"If there is a customary international law saying foundlings can be deemed citizens of the country where they are found, we apply that under the principle of incorporation. It is deemed as municipal law.\" \"But you are still a naturalized citizen, not natural-born. Because if customary international law says a foundling is natural-born, it will violate our Constitution and we cannot apply it here.\" The SET chairman said the principle of jus sanguinis (right of blood) will be the sole basis for one to be considered a natural-born Filipino citizen. He added that the Philippine Constitution requires either of the parents of Ms. Poe to be a Filipino citizen for her to be a natural-born citizen. \"To be natural-born, you must show blood relation,\" Carpio pointed out. Ms. Poe should now prove that her biological parents are Filipinos. With this, the burden of proof shifts to Poe to prove that she is a natural-born Filipino citizen. Carpio said foundlings like Poe could still prove their citizenship through DNA matching. \"If tomorrow you happen to find out by DNA matching that your parent is Filipino, you can still prove that you are natural-born,\" he added. Another justice member of the tribunal, Supreme Court Associate Justice Arturo Brion, supported Carpio's position. He said that it is now up to Poe to prove that she is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines. \"Because Poe's parents are unknown, she must now prove that [they are Filipinos],\" he added. Shift of the burden of proof At the close of the first day of oral argument, the Poe camp looked \"shocked and awed.\" They were at a loss on what to say or do next. (As readers may remember from the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, \"Shock and awe\" was the military doctrine used by the US military in subduing Saddam Hussein and his dreaded armed forces. It seeks to paralyze and destroy the enemy's will to fight.) Poe's counsel had entered the argument hoping to squarely place the burden of proof on David and his counsel. Since David filed the complaint of disqualification, he and his counsel must prove that Senator Poe is not a natural-born Filipino citizen. By the time the first day of hearing ended, the burden of proof had decisively moved to the Poe camp. They would have to prove that the senator is a natural-born citizen, to prevent her ouster from the Senate. That is the only way to show that she is qualified to retain her seat. It is a measure of how gravely the Senator's position was battered, that towards the end Poe's lawyers, Alex Poblador and George Garcia, were telling the court that the Senator already underwent DNA testing \"with a probable biological match\" to prove her Filipino lineage. And other tests are under way with possible siblings. They told the tribunal that the DNA results would be available in two to three weeks. The beginning of the end However the DNA tests turn out, Senator Poe and her campaign have sustained a blow to its confidence and its case that is potentially crippling. There comes a moment for every campaign for the presidency, when it must face adversity and face a moment of truth - when a decision must be made whether to push on or turn back, because the prize may be unattainable. Justice Carpio's comments on the Senator's citizenship status were declarative and crushing. But he is not the tribunal. There are eight other members. Significantly, however, the two other justice members of the tribunal appeared to share Carpio's opinion. It may be that last Monday, September 21, at a hearing room of the Supreme Court, the campaign of Grace Poe for the presidency experienced the beginning of the end. This is the point where Ms. Poe must confront the hard reality that there are serious questions about her qualifications for high office, as well as questions about her fitness for high office. This is where some in the media will begin to wonder whether it is wise to give her such a large megaphone to promote her candidacy. The reality is that although the media love popular candidates like Poe and Duterte, because of their freshness and unpredictability, they can also fall out of love with the flavor of the month. As Arianna Huffington has said, \" When the media fall out of love they fall out of love very quickly.\" yenmakabenta@yahoo.com",
